At Austin Software I work full time as a Software Engineer for their partners. As part of the partner's team, my job is to apply all my software engineering knowledge for the benefit of their business. In addition, I do my best to collaborate on any internal project or initiative needed, writing articles, generating branded content or as a speaker.
