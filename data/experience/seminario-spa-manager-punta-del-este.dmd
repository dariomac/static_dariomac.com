[content:md]
This seminar was focused on managerial abilities that people need to run their spa businesses. The speakers talked about customer support, strategic planning and marketing. Also (and that's why I was a speaker on that seminar) they needed to be aware of how the new technology could help them to make their everyday work easier, safer and more patient-centric. I talked about eHealth and then I introduced ClinicMed, a software made by VAIRIX Software Development to take care of everything in a clinic, from customer information, calendars and room assignments to accountability.
