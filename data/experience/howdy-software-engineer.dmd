At Howdy, I worked full time as a Software Engineer for their partners (until June 2022, when I started doing it part-time). My responsibility as a member of the partner's team is to use all of my experience in software engineering to boost their business. 

In addition, I tried my best to contribute to any internal project or campaign that required it, whether it was writing articles, creating branded material, or speaking. As a result, I started working as a [Developer Advocate in June 2022](/austin-software-developer-advocate).
