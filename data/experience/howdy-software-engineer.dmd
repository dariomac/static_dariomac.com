[content:md]
At Howdy, I worked as a full-time software engineer for their partners. As part of the partner team, I used my software engineering skills to help drive the business forward.

In addition, I did my best to contribute to any internal project or campaign that required it, whether it was writing articles, creating branding material or giving talks. As a result, I started working as [Developer Advocate in June 2022](/austin-software-developer-advocate) moving to full-time in Nov 2023.
