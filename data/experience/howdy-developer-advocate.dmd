[content:md]
Like all DevRel roles, our work lives at the intersection of product, engineering, and marketing. My day job comprises writing docs and blog posts, collecting and sharing developer feedback, actively taking part in (as many) developer communities, and speaking at events, or just being there helping in any way.
