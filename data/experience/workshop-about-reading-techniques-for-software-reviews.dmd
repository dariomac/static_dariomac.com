Workshop about reading techniques for software reviews, conducted at the [Facultad de Ingenieria](http://www.fing.edu.uy/) of the [Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR)](http://www.universidad.edu.uy/), aimed to graduate students and professional developers, maintenance teams members and software project managers. The workshop was part of a graduate course about the software inspection process, particularly the process of [Gilb & Graham](http://www.gilb.com/Inspection). The goal of this workshop was to spread the knowledge generated by the research work being carried out by the software engineering group of Universidad ORT Uruguay and UdelaR.
