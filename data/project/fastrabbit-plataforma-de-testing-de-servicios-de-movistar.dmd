**Disclaimer**: _I've participated in this project **only** on my role of [Tutor](/degree-final-projects-tutor)_

The following project presents FastRabbit, a tool whose main objective is the proactive and preventive testing and monitoring of Telef√≥nica client services for its Movistar brand. The system is developed in NodeJS with NestJS backend framework, React frontend framework and MongoDB database. It is designed to run test cases that interact with various client systems to validate its correct operation and collect performance metrics.

The system consists of four applications: the web interface, the entity management system, the test case execution system and the results processing and storage system. The web interface, called the frontend, will be used by Movistar operations staff to manage test cases and other entities in the system. The test case execution system allows interacting with different services, using different communication protocols such as HTTP, SOAP and Diameter, among others.

The design and architecture of the system are made to allow adding new protocols and functionalities to the system without the need to modify the rest of the system. A product was built to provide a differential value to the client, obtaining validation on their part.
