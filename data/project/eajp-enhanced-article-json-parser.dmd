[summary:string]
This NodeJS module was intended to parse and normalize articlesâ€™ HTML (most of the time in legacy format, with several errors) to a well-structured & easy to use JSON abstraction. The base parser was done by MIC company in JavaScript ES6. Over it base version, I add custom embeds support (Instagram, Twitter, Google Maps, Spotify) using a recursive-asynchronous algorithm. Asynchronously too, the parser take images and ask databases for their metadata (photograph autor, copyright license, etc.). Finally, the parser supports the extension of it using a plugin architecture to avoid the rebuilding of the parser later, when someone of editorial departments need support to new HTML-elements/embeds.
