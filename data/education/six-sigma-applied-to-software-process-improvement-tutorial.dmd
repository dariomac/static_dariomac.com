The seminar "[Six Sigma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma "Six Sigma") Applied to Software Process Improvement" seeks to understand the philosophy and quantitative concepts behind Six Sigma and its application to software engineering.

[Six Sigma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma "Six Sigma") is between a methodology, a philosophy and a set of techniques and practices to improve processes. Its aim to achieve a systematic improvement of the quality of products and services by [statistical control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control "Statistical process control") of the productive process. In this [seminar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminar "Seminar") we will be introducing the main concepts of Six Sigma and reviewing its application to the [software industry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_industry "Software industry"). The seminar is organized around playful exercises where participants will interact in different situations aimed at manipulating and learn the concepts of Six Sigma.

It was dictated by Dr. Tomás San Feliu, PhD in [Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") from [Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha](http://www.uclm.es "University of Castile-La Mancha") and Mr. Santiago Matalonga, PhD student in Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](http://www.upm.es/ "Technical University of Madrid") and [Software Engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering") professor at Universidad ORT Uruguay.
