6 years of courses designed to introduce young students to the language through carefully planned classes to acquire knowledge of the most natural way possible.

The cycle consisted of 6 courses, 3 Juniors (J1, J2, JL) and 3 Senior (S4, S5, S6). Each course was of one year and the 2:30 weekly working hours were divided into 2 classes.

Once finished this cycle I was able to prepare the renowned First Certificate exam, for which I made a preparation course for 1 year (5 hours per week).
