 That is why websites built on React (and other JavaScript platforms) perform worse in Google than websites that primarily serve plain HTML to the crawler.
 
 The best solution is to opt for Server Side Rendering (SSR) or Server Side Generation (SSG) mainly dueÂ to:

> -   Faster initial renders.
> -   Not having to rely on search engine crawlers to render content.
> -   Improvements in TTI due to less JavaScript code for the browser to parse and render before becoming interactive.
