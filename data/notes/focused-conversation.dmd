[short_description:string]

[body:md]
Is a tool that can be used to structure a conversation.

## Stages
It states that conversations should have four phases: objective, reflective, interpretive and decisional [^1].
> You donâ€™t have to spend an hour on each category of question, but ignoring facts to jump to a decision or devaluing reflective questions because you just want to talk about data will not necessarily get you better results. [^2]

### Objective
Facts gathering stage. Answer questions like:
- What are the actual facts?
- What didi you observe?

### Reflective
Thoughts, feelings, and emotions sharing stage. Answer questions like:
- How does this topic make you feel?
- What emotions arise when you think about this objective?

### Interpretive
Insights, interpretations, and analysis generation stage. Answer questions like:
-  Are there any connections or relationships between the shared things?
-  What patterns can we identify in the information we have gathered?

### Decisional
Action and decision-making stage. Answer questions like:
- What experiments could you run?
- What action will you take?
