What is DMARC and how to use it

[pub_date:string]
2022-04-03

[short_description:string]

[body:md]
I've used DMARC as a TXT record on a DNS configured like this:

Name: `1_dmarc.example.com (or just _dmarc for GoDaddy)`

Value: `1v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com`

where:

**v**: is the version of DMARC

**p**: Instructs the receiving mail server what to do with messages that donâ€™t pass authentication. In this case, we want to log messages in a daily report and send it to rua address.

**rua**: Email address to receive reports about DMARC activity for your domain.
