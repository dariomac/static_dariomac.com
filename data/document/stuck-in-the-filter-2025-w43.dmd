Links I couldn't process during the week 43 of 2025.

[pub_date:string]

[short_description:string]
These links for various reasons didn't make it into my public content. They come in many different formats and cover a range of topics that I found interesting or useful. Whether they were too niche, incomplete, or simply didn't fit the overall flow, these links are still valuable resources for some reason they caught my attention.

I didn't invented the idea of grabbing everything I couldn't process and putting it in a document. I just borrowed it (the idea and the name) from the 'Angry Metal Guy' website, which has been doing this for years. You can check their [Stuck in the Filter](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/category/stuck-in-the-filter/) series for more details.
