Links I couldn't process during the week 46 of 2025.

[pub_date:string]
2025-11-14

[short_description:string]
These links for various reasons didn't make it into my public content. They come in many different formats and cover a range of topics that I found interesting or useful. Whether they were too niche, incomplete, or simply didn't fit the overall flow, these links are still valuable resources for some reason they caught my attention.

## Good engineering management is a fad | Irrational Exuberance
[https://lethain.com/good-eng-mgmt-is-a-fad](https://lethain.com/good-eng-mgmt-is-a-fad)

As I get older, I increasingly think about
whether I’m spending my time the right way
to advance my career and my life.
This is also a question that your company
asks about you every performance cycle:
is this engineering manager spending their
time effectively to advance the company or their organization?
Confusingly, in my experience, answering these nominally similar questions
has surprisingly little in common.
This piece spends some time exploring both questions in the particularly
odd moment we live in today, where managers are being told they’ve
spent the last decade doing the wrong things, and need to engage
with a new model of engineering management in order to be
valued by the latest iteration of the industry.

## The New QA Mindset: Testing AI and LLMs - QAlogy
[https://qalogy.com/the-new-qa-mindset-testing-ai-and-llms](https://qalogy.com/the-new-qa-mindset-testing-ai-and-llms)

For years, QA engineers have tested deterministic systems — applications that behave predictably when given specific inputs. But with the rise of AI-driven apps and large language models (LLMs), the rules have changed. The systems we’re testing today are not predictable. They’re probabilistic, data-driven, and can behave differently even when nothing in the code has changed.That’s why we, as QA professionals, need a new mindset.

## Epistemic Testing, Chapter 01 – What Makes a Test a Test? | Masoud Bahrami
[https://masoudbahrami.com/article/epistemic-testing-chapter-01-what-makes-a-test-a-test](https://masoudbahrami.com/article/epistemic-testing-chapter-01-what-makes-a-test-a-test)

“The purpose of a test is not to prove correctness, but to reveal understanding.” We write code to shape ideas into form, but what we really wrestle with every day are the invisible things: assumptions about business logic, intentions buried in variable names, and expectations about how systems will behave when no one is watching. […]

## Comprehension Debt: The Ticking Time Bomb of LLM-Generated Code – Codemanship's Blog

An effect that’s being more and more widely reported is the increase in time it’s taking developers to modify or fix code that was generated by Large Language Models. If you’ve wo…

## 5.0.0
[https://brew.sh/2025/11/12/homebrew-5.0.0](https://brew.sh/2025/11/12/homebrew-5.0.0)

Today, I’d like to announce Homebrew 5.0.0. The most significant changes since 4.6.0 are download concurrency by default, official support for Linux ARM64/AArch64, timescales for deprecating macOS Intel and removing macOS Gatekeeper bypass behaviours.

## How Tinder Decomposed Its iOS Monolith App Handling 70M Users
[https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/how-tinder-decomposed-its-ios-monolith](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/how-tinder-decomposed-its-ios-monolith)

In Tinder’s case, deep inter-dependencies between those targets stretched what engineers call the critical path, which is the longest chain of dependent tasks that determines how long a build takes.

## Do newer AI-native IDEs outperform other AI coding assistants?

Claude Code and Cursor are associated with higher PR throughput, but org size and company stage play a big role.

I didn't invented the idea of grabbing everything I couldn't process and putting it in a document. I just borrowed it (the idea and the name) from the 'Angry Metal Guy' website, which has been doing this for years.
