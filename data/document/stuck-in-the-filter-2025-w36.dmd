Links I couldn't process during the week 36 of 2025.

[pub_date:string]
2025-09-05

[short_description:string]
These links for various reasons didn't make it into my public content. They come in many different formats and cover a range of topics that I found interesting or useful. Whether they were too niche, incomplete, or simply didn't fit the overall flow, these links are still valuable resources for some reason they caught my attention.

## The cost of compute: A $7 trillion race to scale data centers
[https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-dollar-race-to-scale-data-centers](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-dollar-race-to-scale-data-centers)

AI is fueling high demand for compute power, with companies investing billions in infrastructure. We look at how to approach this growing challenge.

## Weaponizing image scaling against production AI systems
[https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/08/21/weaponizing-image-scaling-against-production-ai-systems/](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/08/21/weaponizing-image-scaling-against-production-ai-systems/)

In this blog post, we’ll detail how attackers can exploit image scaling on Gemini CLI, Vertex AI Studio, Gemini’s web and API interfaces, Google Assistant, Genspark, and other production AI systems. We’ll also explain how to mitigate and defend against these attacks, and we’ll introduce Anamorpher, our open-source tool that lets you explore and generate these crafted images.

## OpenAI is using legal threats to harass its critics
[https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/09/04/openai-is-using-legal-threats-to-harass-its-critics/](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/09/04/openai-is-using-legal-threats-to-harass-its-critics/)

OpenAI has found a new way to suck: harassing its critics with spurious legal threats and subpoenas! The paper-thin justification for this is that OpenAI thinks anyone hampering it in any way from …

I didn't invented the idea of grabbing everything I couldn't process and putting it in a document. I just borrowed it (the idea and the name) from the 'Angry Metal Guy' website, which has been doing this for years. You can check their [Stuck in the Filter](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/category/stuck-in-the-filter/) series for more details.
