I didn't invented the idea of grabbing everything I couldn't process and putting it in a document. I just borrowed it (the idea and the name) from the 'Angry Metal Guy' website, which has been doing this for years. You can check their [Stuck in the Filter](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/category/stuck-in-the-filter/) series for more details.
