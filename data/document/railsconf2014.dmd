Virtual covering of the RailsConf held in Chicago - US - Apr 22-25, 2014

[body:md]
As the conference page says, RailsConf is â€œthe largest gathering of Ruby and Rails developers in the world" and this year will be held in Chicago from April 22nd - 25th. Alvaro, the CTO and one of Vairix co-founders will be there to participate in the conference and connect with top Rails talent, companies, and project owners from around the world.

As we have done with [JSConf 2014](/jsconf2014), we shared tweets, photographs, articles and all the stuff that Alvaro sent to us directly from the conference.
