[body:md]
As the conference page says, RailsConf is â€œthe largest gathering of Ruby and Rails developers in the world" and this year will be held in Chicago from April 22nd - 25th. Alvaro, the CTO and one of Vairix co-founders will be there to participate in the conference and connect with top Rails talent, companies, and project owners from around the world.

As we have done with JSConf 2014 ( [day 1](http://vairix.com/blog/jsconf-uruguay-2014-day-1) and [2](http://vairix.com/blog/jsconf-uruguay-2014-day-2)), we sared tweets, photographs, articles and all the stuff that Alvaro sent to us directly from the conference.
