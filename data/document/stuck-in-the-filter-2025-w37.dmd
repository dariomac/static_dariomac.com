Links I couldn't process during the week 37 of 2025.

[pub_date:string]
2025-09-12

[short_description:string]
These links for various reasons didn't make it into my public content. They come in many different formats and cover a range of topics that I found interesting or useful. Whether they were too niche, incomplete, or simply didn't fit the overall flow, these links are still valuable resources for some reason they caught my attention.

## Engineering excellence starts on edge
[https://world.hey.com/dhh/engineering-excellence-starts-on-edge-c36e4c59](https://world.hey.com/dhh/engineering-excellence-starts-on-edge-c36e4c59)

The best engineering teams take control of their tools. They help develop the frameworks and libraries they depend on, and they do this by running production code on edge ‚Äî the unreleased next version. That‚Äôs where progress is made, that‚Äôs where participation matters most. This sounds scary at first. Edge? Isn‚Äôt that just another word‚Ä¶

I didn't invented the idea of grabbing everything I couldn't process and putting it in a document. I just borrowed it (the idea and the name) from the 'Angry Metal Guy' website, which has been doing this for years. You can check their [Stuck in the Filter](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/category/stuck-in-the-filter/) series for more details.
