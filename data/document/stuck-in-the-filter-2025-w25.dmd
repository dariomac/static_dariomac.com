These are the notes I couldn't process during this week. I didn't created the idea... all the credit goes to the AMG crew (as I explained here https://www.angrymetalguy.com/category/stuck-in-the-filter/).

## Why Claude Code feels like magic?
[https://omarabid.com/claude-magic](https://omarabid.com/claude-magic)

It takes these very simple-minded instructions - ‘Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it’s greater than this other number’ - but executes them at a rate of, let’s say, 1,000,000 per second. At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic. — Steve Jobs

## Asking What—When—Where—Why—Who—How… and Then Some… for the Toyota Practical Problem Solving – AllAboutLean.com
[https://www.allaboutlean.com/what-when-where-why-who-how/](https://www.allaboutlean.com/what-when-where-why-who-how/)

The Toyota Practical Problem Solving is a very structured approach to solve problems. The underlying PDCA is broken down into multiple steps, where the “Plan” part especially is divided into Clarify the Problem, Break Down the Problem, Set a Target, and a Root-Cause Analysis. In this post I will look at the What—When—Where—Why—Who—How structure, also known as the 5W1H, that can help you when clarifying the problem. This structure was used in journalism starting around 1913, but may originate from Greek antiquity. It is also a useful structure for problem solving.
