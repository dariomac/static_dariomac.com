[summary:string]
Links I couldn't process during the week 25 of 2025.

[pub_date:string]
2025-06-20

[short_description:string]
These links for various reasons didn't make it into my public content. They come in many different formats and cover a range of topics that I found interesting or useful. Whether they were too niche, incomplete, or simply didn't fit the overall flow, these links are still valuable resources for some reason they caught my attention.

## Asking What—When—Where—Why—Who—How… and Then Some… for the Toyota Practical Problem Solving – AllAboutLean.com
[https://www.allaboutlean.com/what-when-where-why-who-how/](https://www.allaboutlean.com/what-when-where-why-who-how/)

The Toyota Practical Problem Solving is a very structured approach to solve problems. The underlying PDCA is broken down into multiple steps, where the “Plan” part especially is divided into Clarify the Problem, Break Down the Problem, Set a Target, and a Root-Cause Analysis. In this post I will look at the What—When—Where—Why—Who—How structure, also known as the 5W1H, that can help you when clarifying the problem. This structure was used in journalism starting around 1913, but may originate from Greek antiquity. It is also a useful structure for problem solving.

## Why Claude Code feels like magic?
[https://omarabid.com/claude-magic](https://omarabid.com/claude-magic)

It takes these very simple-minded instructions - ‘Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it’s greater than this other number’ - but executes them at a rate of, let’s say, 1,000,000 per second. At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic. — Steve Jobs

I didn't invented the idea of grabbing everything I couldn't process and putting it in a document. I just borrowed it (the idea and the name) from the 'Angry Metal Guy' website, which has been doing this for years. You can check their [Stuck in the Filter](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/category/stuck-in-the-filter/) series for more details.
