[summary:string]
Links I couldn't process during the week 26 of 2025.

[pub_date:string]
2025-06-27

[short_description:string]
These links for various reasons didn't make it into my public content. They come in many different formats and cover a range of topics that I found interesting or useful. Whether they were too niche, incomplete, or simply didn't fit the overall flow, these links are still valuable resources for some reason they caught my attention.

## Learn like a lurker: Gen Z’s digital-first lifestyle and the future of knowledge - Stack Overflow
[https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/06/18/learn-like-a-lurker-gen-z-s-digital-first-lifestyle-and-the-future-of-knowledge](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/06/18/learn-like-a-lurker-gen-z-s-digital-first-lifestyle-and-the-future-of-knowledge)

Every generation receives some level of get-off-my-lawn-ism—the unavoidable battering of older generations upon the young about work ethic, lifestyle, and morality. As Gen Z myself, I’ve become well-adjusted to it. And not to be a generation traitor, I do think I’m a bit brain rotted. The prevalence of fingerwagging at Gen Z doesn’t surprise me anymore, so when I started at Stack, I wasn’t surprised by the 415th episode of the Stack Overflow Podcast, entitled “Gen Z doesn’t understand file structures.” The title makes the episode sound more critical than it is—the conversation is a fun ride through getting ratio’d by KPop Twitter and how age-old institutions like higher education are having to adjust to the way Gen Z thinks. But it highlights a reality: that Zoomers navigate the technical world very differently than generations past.

## Que el LLM no te tape el bosque #2 - ese gran malentendido llamado user stories

Nunca conocí personalmente a Kent Beck. Lo que voy a contar está basado en algo que le escuché Alistair Cockburn, quien supuestamente lo charló con el bueno de Kent.

I didn't invented the idea of grabbing everything I couldn't process and putting it in a document. I just borrowed it (the idea and the name) from the 'Angry Metal Guy' website, which has been doing this for years.
