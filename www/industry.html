        <p>
              <p>My profile can be defined as an elastic one, mostly because of my adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>I can lead projects (as <strong>PM</strong> or <strong>Scrum Master</strong>) following agile methodologies (<strong>Scrum</strong>, XP) or more traditional ones, taking care of the complete SLDC (mainly requirement elicitation/specification and <strong>quality assurance</strong>). In my role as a final-year project tutor at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I constantly face new challenges, but more than anything, new teams of people. I believe in self-managed teams and feel satisfied knowing that during our time working together, we grew individually and as a team.</p>
<p>Also, I love coding. My management skills are complemented by in-depth technical knowledge, ranging from defining high-performance architectures (<strong>NGINX</strong>, <strong>PM2</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, in-memory or database caches) to the use of backend technologies (<strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, .Net, <strong>Java</strong>), databases (<strong>MySql</strong>, PostgreSQL, <strong>Oracle</strong>, <strong>SQL Server</strong>), web frameworks (<strong>ASP</strong><strong>.NET</strong> <strong>MVC</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>) and frontend ones (<strong>JavaScript</strong>, React, Handlebars, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Highcharts JS</strong>, <strong>SVG</strong>).</p>
<p>Besides this, and perhaps because I am a Software Engineering professor at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I feel very comfortable speaking in public. For this reason, I usually contribute to improving the visibility of the companies where I work by participating in conferences as a speaker, writing articles in blogs and even adding content to Twitter (and other <strong>social networks</strong>).</p>
<p>Finally, I am interested in conducting <strong>scientific research</strong> in the field of Software Engineering to add value to its body of knowledge. At the same time, I want to satisfy some practical needs of the industry, especially those related to <strong>quality assurance</strong> and <strong>decision making</strong>. I think it may be helpful to bring tools from the scientific environment closer to the daily activities of software development. In order to achieve this objective and to make a first approximation to the scientific field, I did a Master in Engineering at Universidad ORT Uruguay.</p>
