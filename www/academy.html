          <p>
                <p>My profile can be defined as an elastic one, mostly because of my adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>I can lead projects (as <strong>PM</strong> or <strong>Scrum Master</strong>) following agile methodologies (<strong>Scrum</strong>, XP) or more traditional ones, taking care of the complete SLDC (mainly requirement elicitation/specification and <strong>quality assurance</strong>). In my role as a final-year project tutor at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I constantly face new challenges, but more than anything, new teams of people. I believe in self-managed teams and feel satisfied knowing that during our time working together, we grew individually and as a team.</p>
<p>Also, I love coding. My management skills are complemented by in-depth technical knowledge, ranging from defining high-performance architectures (<strong>NGINX</strong>, <strong>PM2</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, in-memory or database caches) to the use of backend technologies (<strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, .Net, <strong>Java</strong>), databases (<strong>MySql</strong>, PostgreSQL, <strong>Oracle</strong>, <strong>SQL Server</strong>), web frameworks (<strong>ASP</strong><strong>.NET</strong> <strong>MVC</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>) and frontend ones (<strong>JavaScript</strong>, React, Handlebars, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Highcharts JS</strong>, <strong>SVG</strong>).</p>
<p>Besides this, and perhaps because I am a Software Engineering professor at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I feel very comfortable speaking in public. For this reason, I usually contribute to improving the visibility of the companies where I work by participating in conferences as a speaker, writing articles in blogs and even adding content to Twitter (and other <strong>social networks</strong>).</p>
<p>Finally, I am interested in conducting <strong>scientific research</strong> in the field of Software Engineering to add value to its body of knowledge. At the same time, I want to satisfy some practical needs of the industry, especially those related to <strong>quality assurance</strong> and <strong>decision making</strong>. I think it may be helpful to bring tools from the scientific environment closer to the daily activities of software development. In order to achieve this objective and to make a first approximation to the scientific field, I did a <strong>Master</strong> in Engineering at Universidad ORT Uruguay.</p>

Other operational functions are the development and implementation of strategies to align personnel with company goals. Also, I make continuous improvements in the public visibility of the company, taking care of the blog, the <strong>social networks</strong> engagement and participating in <strong>conferences as speaker</strong>.</p>

              <h2>Software inspection adoption: A mapping study</h2>
              <p><i>Darío Macchi, Martín Solari (2012). Software inspection adoption: A mapping study. In Conferencia Latinoamericana de Informática (CLEI 2012).</i></p>
              <p>In the technical literature of Software Engineering, references about the benefits of software inspections are abundant. On the contrary, some authors raise the problem of the scarce adoption of this process. From this position, we review the literature to produce a map of the most researched issues in the area, the factors that cause low adoption and possible solutions. The main conclusion was that most of the factors causing low adoption are related to developers' perceptions of the process, lack of training and some characteristics of the process such as rigidity, complexity and the difficulty of connecting the effort made with the quality of the final product. These factors should be studied in future work.</p>

              <h2>Diagnóstico del Uso de Técnicas de  Revisión de Software en Uruguay</h2>
              <p><i>Darío Macchi, Martín Solari (2013) Diagnóstico del Uso de Técnicas de  Revisión de Software en Uruguay. In XVI Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering (CibSE 2013).</i></p>
              <p>There are different fault detection static techniques, but the reviews are specials because they don't require the execution of the artifact to be evaluated. The objective of this research is to understand how different artifacts are being reviewed during the software development process. It performs a survey for software development professionals who do activities related to <strong>quality assurance</strong> and process definition. The survey results show that no formal review techniques are used, but different software artifacts are checked using less formal and systematic techniques (ad-hoc and peer review techniques). Regarding the artifacts, the most reviewed are those which are key to the development process, highly risky for project success and highly visible for the user. These are the requirements specifications and design documents, code and user interface respectively. Since the use of non-formal revisions are large, you can search for process quality improvements by the adoption of practices from more formal techniques such as the use of reading techniques and support tools through ongoing training.</p>
