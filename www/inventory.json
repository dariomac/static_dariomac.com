Se realiza una encuesta online dirigida a profesionales en desarrollo de software, vinculados a actividades de aseguramiento de calidad o definición de procesos. Los resultados de la encuesta indican que no se utilizan técnicas formales de revisión aunque distintos artefactos de software son revisados mediante técnicas menos formales y sistemáticas (técnicas ad-hoc y revisiones de pares). Respecto a los artefactos, los más revisados son claves para el proceso de desarrollo, de alto riesgo para el éxito del proyecto y de alta visibilidad de cara al usuario. Estos son las especificaciones de requerimientos y documentos de diseño, el código y la interfaz de usuario respectivamente. Dado que el uso de revisiones no formales es amplio, se pueden buscar mejoras en la calidad de dichos procesos adoptando prácticas de técnicas más formales como el uso de técnicas de lectura y herramientas de apoyo a través de la capacitación permanente.</p>\n","more_info":"<p>You can download the full text version from <a href=\"/assets/diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This article was presented at the XVI Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering (CibSE 2013) held in Montevideo, Uruguay on April 9, 2013.</p>\n<p>The Powerpoint file used to that conference can be downloaded <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/dariomac/macchi-cibseis20cibse2013\">here</a>.</p>\n","related_images":[{"filename":"art_cibse2013_1.jpg","index":1,"total":3,"isFirst":true,"isLast":false},{"filename":"art_cibse2013_2.jpg","index":2,"total":3,"isFirst":false,"isLast":false},{"filename":"art_cibse2013_3.jpg","index":3,"total":3,"isFirst":false,"isLast":true}],"attachments":[{"filename":"diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay.pdf","description":"This is my self hosted version of the article."}]},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/article/diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay.dmd","slug":"diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay","fdate":"March 17th 2017","outputFilename":"diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay.html","links":["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_detection_and_isolation","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface","/assets/diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay.pdf","http://www.slideshare.net/dariomac/macchi-cibseis20cibse2013"]},"index":2,"total":154,"isFirst":false,"isLast":false},

From the outside, they seem to be normal scrum teams, but they lack the beating heart of potentially releasable increment at the end of each sprint. Also, these teams have no intention to improve their situation and their stakeholders have forgotten its existence long time ago.\n\nAn Orc Scrum Team is a new kind of team that I was trying to define for a while now.\n\nBeings of greater (evilish) power(managers) build Orc Scrum Teams to be in fashion, but they lead them as battle fodder in battles that, as the zombies, only can be won because of the elevated number of them. Old, rigid organizations are survivors, so Scrum didn’t change them as everyone supposed will happen; old, rigid organizations changed Scrum.","acknowledgments":"<p><a href=\"https://www.vairix.com/tech-blog/zombie-orc-scrum-teams\">This post</a> was written for Vairix Software Development, so I want say thanks to them for let me share this with you in my homepage.</p>\n","further_reading":"<ul>\n<li>Zombie Scrum -

Candidates of this Master program achieve their education primarily through research activities, which lead to the development of a final thesis under the supervision of an active researcher within a research group of the Faculty.</p>\n<p>The emphasis on research distinguishes this program from those that are primarily based on courses and other educational activities. For these reasons, the link to one of the research groups operating in the Faculty is a key element for the completion of this master.</p>\n<p>This contact should be established right from the beginning. As one of our admission requirements, a researcher must accept to be the academic advisor of the prospective Master student (the admission of each student is also subject to acceptance by an admissions committee). The academic advisor will be responsible for mentoring the educational development of the candidate.</p>\n<p>Additionally, during the first year of studies the student will elaborate a draft of his thesis in which he chooses a topic and proposes a plan for the development of his project.</p>\n<p>This draft must be approved before the student begins work on the thesis itself, which will take place during the second year of studies. The elaboration of the draft, and of course, the thesis work itself, will take place within a research group of the Faculty.</p>\n<p>The research groups belong to the different branches of Engineering that operate in the Faculty: Electronics, Telecommunications or Systems.</p>\n<p>Our students will obtain a degree of Master in Engineering (by research), with specialization in the field covered by the final thesis and the major chosen by the student.</p>\n<p>In addition to his research activities, the student must take advanced subjects and take part in other similar activities in order to cover different areas of knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Graduate Profile</strong></p>\n<p>The graduate of this program will have achieved sufficient command of his area to perform a critical assessment of its state of the art, and to contribute at least with one opportunity or line of work for development or original application of ideas.</p>\n<p>This will be reflected in his final thesis, which is supposed to be a significant contribution to the literature of the area because of its approach and its creative use of knowledge, pointing out opportunities for innovation or strategies for an original solution of problems.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the graduates of this program will have developed learning skills that would allow them to continue their education at Doctoral level, which requires the ability to deal with original research work on an increased level of autonomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Accreditation</strong></p>\n<p>The Master in Engineering (by research) is a graduate program, which started the recognition process at the Ministry of Education and Culture in January 2, 2009.</p>\n<p><strong>Master thesis defense</strong></p>\n<p>I defended my thesis on April 5, 2013 at Seminary Room of the Universidad ORT Uruguay.</p>\n<p>The powerpoint presentation used in the defense can be downloaded from <a href=\"/assets/Macchi-Defensa-Tesis.pdf\">here</a>.

There are many reasons not to try this longshot, but I read somewhere that &quot;everything is impossible before someone does it&quot;; and you certainly have a lot of people working from various parts of the world... so here we go.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-me\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"about-me\" href=\"#about-me\" class=\"no_external_ico\">About me</a></h2>\n<p>My name is Darío Macchi, I’m 38 years old, from Uruguay. I have been married for 7 years and am the proud father of two little girls (6 yo and 3 yo). Beside my job in the software development industry, I’ve been a <a href=\"https://dariomac.com/software-engineering-professor\">Software Engineer Professor</a> at the same university where, at the age of 11, I decided that I wanted to study and get my degree. I will not repeat what is in <a href=\"https://dariomac.com/industry+basecamp-developer\">my standard resume</a>; instead, I will tell you some of my personal attributes and my way of thinking.</p>\n<p>I don't believe in traditional resumes, so I prefer <a href=\"https://dariomac.com/kanbancv\">alternative ways of introducing myself</a>. I think that <a href=\"https://dariomac.com\">showing everyone</a> what I'm doing is a better way to make myself known and also, leads to quick (and sometimes deadly) honest feedback! So, this application is not the exception.</p>\n<p>I don't like to follow trends or develop software aligned to fashion principles; I don't overuse great ideas/concepts/tools (e.g. operator overloading, factories, lambdas for everything, React.js where is not needed, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNdqZhWAHKg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=805&amp;hl=es&amp;cc_lang_pref=en&amp;cc=1\">Scrum as the new black</a> and a very long etc.) to be fancy. Software is about people. Most of the time we are doing abstractions and modeling real processes that people actually follow everyday. So at the end of the day, we are serving people. I've been doing that for my teams, students and end users forever, and I believe in being trustable. To do that, you have to know what you're talking about, being capable of justify decisions beyond the &quot;it's fancy... this is new tech... oh no, that's old school... everybody is using this&quot;.</p>\n<p>I know Basecamp, your history (from the times of 37signals), I've worked with Turbolinks and Trix and in a moment I will jump to what I have to offer to your team.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-i-do\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"what-i-do\" href=\"#what-i-do\" class=\"no_external_ico\">What I do</a></h2>\n<p>I define myself as a curious, fast-learning guy. Just think about how my technology stack has changed/growed over my 20 years in the industry. I'm always on side projects: now with a <a href=\"https://dariomac.com/requirements-inspection-tool-for-a-low-code-platform\">requirements inspection tool for a low-code platform</a>; before, porting my personal website from RoR to a portable, <a href=\"https://dariomac.com/static-website-generator\">technology agnostic content manager</a> in Node.js (this website and my standard resume generator); a note taking PoC with Trix to automatically link related content using a trie data structure; Clojure, Lisp, you name it. I know what this may look: “this guy didn't have the time to go deep in almost any of these technologies and only scratch the surface of them” and in a certain way that’s true. But also is true that HTML, vanilla Javascript and CSS were always there, and that is why I love, respect and prefer that triad over anything else.</p>\n<p>When I was the architect (and lead developer) of a <a href=\"https://www.dariomac.com/content-distribution-system\">high traffic microservices</a> solution (<a href=\"https://www.vix.com/en/\">VIX</a>), I chose that triad to be the core of it, following an architecture mostly like your “HTML over the wire”. Indeed, I had a PoC working with turbolinks for almost a month that was finally discarded toward a self-made smaller and simpler solution to fit our specific needs. We used intersection observers for image loading, embeds (lot of them) and infinite scrolling, Handlebars for server (and a bit of client) side rendering and a custom client-side router. From that project we built 2 frameworks/tools (<a href=\"https://www.dariomac.com/eajp-enhanced-article-json-parser\">Enhanced Article-JSON Parser</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dariomac.com/traceability-logger\">Traceability Logger</a>) plus the current solution, that is extensible (as a framework) by design. We had a rollout of almost a year where we slowly replaced the existing solution.</p>\n<p>Also, I'm a <strong>manager of one</strong>. If you don't believe me, see what's a regular work day for me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I put play on my personal time management tool on my cell phone. I like to work in chunks of 25 mins with 5-10 of rest between them (the old pomodoro).</li>\n<li>I use <a href=\"https://dariomac.com/how-bullet-journal-changed-my-work-routine\">bullet journal</a> for managing my everyday tasks (yes, with a pen, in a notebook). So, in the first pomodoro run I starts moving missing/unfinished tasks from the day before. Then add today's tasks and prioritize.</li>\n<li>As the day goes on, I mark finished tasks, add new ones or take side notes and sketch ideas.\nThis journal let me keep track of my work, plan and reflect about them. Also, I'm always trying to follow <a href=\"https://dariomac.com/manifesto\">my manifesto</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"why-do-i-want-this-position\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"why-do-i-want-this-position\" href=\"#why-do-i-want-this-position\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Why do I want this position?</a></h2>\n<p>In 2019 I decided not to commute anymore but I couldn't make it, so I want to try it now. Why? Well, I love my house. It has all I ever wanted and it was so hard to get, that now, I don't want to be 8 hours (plus 2 of commuting) away from it.</p>\n<p>I consider this opportunity to be unique, mostly because your offering touches very important topics for me. Being completely honest with you, the most important is that I'll be working with web development stars in a high-profile company, from my home for a salary that let me ensure my family wellness.</p>\n<p>Also (and not less important)... when reading about the position I felt that we have known each other for a long time, and that the description was written after talking together about how ideal companies should behave. I felt in my gut, confidence, happiness and a complete sense of tranquility.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-do-i-have-to-offer\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"what-do-i-have-to-offer\" href=\"#what-do-i-have-to-offer\" class=\"no_external_ico\">What do I have to offer?</a></h2>\n<p>I can offer a <strong>well-proven structured way of dealing with problems</strong>, organizing them and working carefully in small steps towards solutions. I search for evidence before making assertions or taking important decisions (due to that thing of being trustable).</p>\n<p><strong>Visibility</strong>. I know you guys don't need more of that, but I'm always being active in social networks, trying to be accepted as a speaker in conferences (like my <a href=\"https://dariomac.com/jis-uy-2019-scrum-zombies-and-orcs-teams\">Scrum Zombies &amp; Orcs teams</a> speak) and letting others know about what I'm learning in my awesome everyday work life. I can even start to imagine how working at Basecamp would affect my life in this regard.</p>\n<p><strong>Good technical skills</strong>. I'm not the best, but I'm good enough to know that my missing skills are complemented by my deep love for this profession. But <strong>I'm unbeatable</strong> when my team needs me and I have to be at their height quickly (e.g. I learned 11 frontend new technologies -between frameworks, libraries and tools- in the last 6 months to help in a project that was on-fire).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"final-thoughts\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"final-thoughts\" href=\"#final-thoughts\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Final thoughts</a></h2>\n<p>First of all, thanks for taking the time to read through this. I know you should have many letters to review, most of them saying the same things. So I will do a closing saying something that any of them can: I'm from <a href=\"https://medium.com/bros/uruguay-the-silicon-valley-of-south-america-8cdef0bbcadc\">Uruguay, the Silicon Valley of South America</a>; the best version of me is in the morning, when I work drinking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)\">mate</a>; I love my kids and my wife and they would be very happy finding me working at home back from school. Words always fail to describe beautiful things, so if this letter doesn't convince you, perhaps my promise to eat the best <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asado\">asado</a> will 😉.</p>\n<p>Regards.</p>\n","related_images":[{"filename":"basecamp_application.jpg","title":"Night mode.

Well, perfect. The first slide\nwill be very easy, then.\n\n0:00:52.600,0:00:55.400\nBut just for those who didn’t raise their\nhand.\n\n0:00:55.400,0:00:56.880\nWhat do we understand by Scrum?\n\n0:00:56.880,0:01:00.680\nWe have a client that brings a value proposition,\nright?\n\n0:01:00.680,0:01:06.600\nWhen that value proposition is understandable\nand clear, the team takes that value proposition,\n\n0:01:06.600,0:01:11.040\nthey work on it for a period of time we call\n“sprint”.\n\n0:01:11.040,0:01:17.760\nDuring that period of time, things come up\nwhich the team solves: impediments, problems, situations.\n\n0:01:17.760,0:01:21.560\nUntil this value proposition becomes a product\nincrement.\n\n0:01:21.560,0:01:27.160\nAt this point, when we believe it’s ready,\nwe deliver it to the client, and basically\n\n0:01:27.160,0:01:29.320\nthat is where that workflow ends.\n\n0:01:29.320,0:01:34.640\nThe amount of value that we generate in that\nperiod of time is what we usually call “speed”.\n\n0:01:34.640,0:01:37.200\nSo far it’s simple: you already know what\nScrum is.\n\n0:01:37.200,0:01:39.760\nAre you sure you know what Scrum is?\n\n0:01:39.760,0:01:44.360\nYes? Stay with that question because you may\nhesitate later.\n\n0:01:44.360,0:01:46.400\nYes? Good, let’s continue.\n\n0:01:46.400,0:01:51.120\nLet’s go to the main topic which is “What\nare Zombies?”\n\n0:01:51.120,0:01:55.480\nWhat do we understand by a Zombie, technically?\n\n0:01:55.480,0:01:58.600\nA zombie is a being that was once alive, right?\n\n0:01:58.600,0:02:01.480\nThey had a heart with a strong heartbeat.\n\n0:02:01.520,0:02:07.680\nBut as a result of contagion of the zombie\ngene\n\n0:02:07.680,0:02:13.840\nthey basically became a crude and slow being.\n\n0:02:14.080,0:02:19.560\nA being that has reduced intelligence, and\ndue to that reduced intelligence\n\n0:02:19.560,0:02:22.160\nneeds to act in big numbers in order to achieve their\ngoals.\n\n0:02:22.160,0:02:29.500\nThat’s why it is said that zombieism is\nhighly contagious in healthy societies.\n\n0:02:29.500,0:02:35.280\nNow, what does this have to do with Scrum?\nWell, let’s see.\n\n0:02:35.280,0:02:42.480\nA Zombie Scrum Team is a team that lacks a\nheartbeat.\n\n0:02:42.480,0:02:45.040\nFrom the outside, they look like a normal\nScrum team.\n\n0:02:45.040,0:02:48.000\nThey have all their ceremonies, their roles,\nand so on.\n\n0:02:48.000,0:02:49.440\nBut its heart does not beat.\n\n0:02:49.480,0:02:55.060\nWhat is the heart of an Agile team? Sorry,\nof a Scrum team?\n\n0:02:55.060,0:02:58.940\nThe constant delivery of value in each sprint.\n\n0:02:58.940,0:03:06.260\nSo, these teams do not have a heartbeat, which means they are not delivering value in each sprint.\n\n0:03:06.260,0:03:15.420\nIf that is the heart of a Scrum team, their blood is the need to improve that value delivery with each sprint, right?\n\n0:03:15.420,0:03:26.280\nClearly, Zombie teams don’t have either of these characteristics, even though, as I said, they abide by all the Scrum roles and ceremonies.\n\n0:03:26.280,0:03:42.560\nSo, what happens here? Let’s look into some symptoms that will allow you to identify when a team is becoming a zombie team, and try to revert that effect.\n\n0:03:42.580,0:03:46.260\nThe slides are going backwards, let’s go forward. Good, there.\n\n0:03:46.260,0:03:54.760\nI had to Google what sound a zombie would make, how we could spell the sound a zombie makes. And this is the best I could find, okay?\n\n0:03:54.760,0:03:58.920\nAnd this would mean “Symptoms” in zombie slang, just an editor’s note.\n\n0:03:58.920,0:04:09.960\nGood. All of you told me you know what Scrum is, right? So I assume you all hold retrospective meetings, right? Do we all agree? Raise your hand once more.\n\n0:04:09.960,0:04:13.160\nYes? You all hold retrospective meetings, you know what they are. Well, perfect.\n\n0:04:13.160,0:04:21.320\nNow, how many of you hold retrospective meetings where you challenge the team with creative activities?\n\n0:04:21.320,0:04:34.060\nHow many of you have taken part in retrospective meetings where the team tries to find clear goals, and those goals are translated into concrete and defined actions?\n\n0:04:34.060,0:04:45.880\nHow many of you have taken part in retrospective meetings where the team is asked to dream big, and then those dreams are expressed through actionable points?\n\n0:04:45.880,0:04:56.740\nHow many of you have analyzed risks during retrospective meetings and have looked for solutions as a team, or have simply analyzed how you feel working together?\n\n0:04:56.740,0:05:00.660\nRaise your hand: How many of you have this happened to?\n\n0:05:00.660,0:05:12.520\nNow, how many of you have had to resort to the good old sad, happy, and light bulb emojis during retrospective meetings?\n\n0:05:12.520,0:05:21.280\nGood. If you find yourself belonging to the first group, in the first Scrum team, I can tell you that you can be at ease.\n\n0:05:21.280,0:05:24.860\nYou will continue to be alive, and will avoid being zombies. Okay?\n\n0:05:24.860,0:05:40.240\nAs for the second team, whom I intentionally didn’t ask to raise their hands so as to not make them feel bad, but I reckon it’s the majority, this is possibly an early sign that you are becoming a zombie without your being aware of it.\n\n0:05:40.240,0:05:51.860\nRight? This is a first symptom that the team is losing agility, that their heartbeat is dropping. They are starting to abandon certain things.\n\n0:05:51.860,0:05:57.220\nLet’s have a look at what a developer said on this topic:\n\n0:05:57.220,0:06:08.380\n“Really? I have to go to these dumb retrospective meeting again? Well, I’m bored anyways. Who cares? At least the Scrum Master is here today. Gasp. Like he’s of any use.”\n\n0:06:08.380,0:06:12.040\nRight? I see some of you laughing.\nGood.\n\n0:06:12.040,0:06:14.900\nWhat is wrong with this guy? He doesn’t get it.\n\n0:06:14.900,0:06:20.400\nThis person does not understand the value of a retrospective. He does not understand...\n\n0:06:20.400,0:06:22.400\nWhat makes an Agile team boring?\n\n0:06:22.400,0:06:27.520\nAlso, if you are bored within an Agile team, the retrospective meeting is precisely the place to address that.\n\n0:06:27.520,0:06:32.820\nIn fact, he didn’t even understand the value that a Scrum Master has within Scrum.\n\n0:06:32.820,0:06:38.060\nAnd the Scrum Master himself doesn’t seem to understand as he apparently doesn’t show up very often.\n\n0:06:38.060,0:06:40.420\nBut everything about this statement is wrong. Right?\n\n0:06:40.420,0:06:51.340\nI mean, there are several issues that are related to what we talked about earlier: With the blood, with the need to improve. Right? Good.\n\n0:06:51.340,0:06:54.860\nAnother symptom...\nI ranked this first one as the worst of them.\n\n0:06:54.860,0:07:01.520\nBecause I personally think retrospective meetings are very important, and it’s there where we usually start to turn into zombies.\n\n0:07:01.520,0:07:04.200\nLet’s look at this other symptom then.\n\n0:07:04.200,0:07:14.000\n“Complete functionalities are desirable, but if it doesn’t happen in this sprint, we can finish them in the next one… After all, we aren’t going to production at the end of the sprint”.\n\n0:07:14.000,0:07:25.920\nAgain: We said that the heart of a Scrum team is precisely adding value sprint after sprint. And now we are confronted with this affirmation.\n\n0:07:25.920,0:07:35.200\nThe fact that we go or don’t go to production at the end of the sprint is not up to us. We committed to delivering a certain value to the client by the end of the sprint.\n\n0:07:35.200,0:07:42.020\nAnd the client will decide what he wants to do with that value. Our responsibility is delivering working software to the client. Right?\n\n0:07:42.020,0:07:47.960\nSo again, when we fall into these kinds of issues is when we start becoming zombies.\n\n0:07:47.960,0:07:49.700\nLet’s look at another symptom:\n\n0:07:49.700,0:08:00.340\n“In the last sprint we did the whole backlog, it wasn’t so hard… in this sprint there were tasks that will remain as pending for the following sprint, so we didn’t have a sprint review as we don’t have anything to prove anyways.\n\n0:08:00.340,0:08:11.540\nI don’t know why we didn’t stretch the sprint duration, like we did in the last one, to reach the scope that we committed to…  After all, iterations are artificial…”.\n\n0:08:11.540,0:08:23.620\nWe may be witnessing another symptom in this affirmation, and that’s when the team may be doing what is known as “cherry-picking” of Scrum activities. Cherry-picking of GIT.\n\n0:08:23.620,0:08:25.800\nThose who have worked with GIT know what it means.\n\n0:08:25.800,0:08:38.260\nBasically, the team is picking what Scrum practices to include, at which point in time, and adapting them to their situation in order to make the whole thing  fit.\n\n0:08:38.260,0:08:47.920\nSo we stretch sprints to accomplish goals. \nAnd maybe one day we don’t do a review meeting because we don’t have anything to show, like in this example.\n\n0:08:47.920,0:08:53.500\nOr, given we are behind schedule, we skip the retrospective and don’t do it.\nRight?\n\n0:08:53.500,0:08:58.180\nLet’s look at the last symptom of “Zombieism”:\n\n0:08:58.180,0:09:06.180\n“I don’t care whether the overall product doesn’t meet the client’s expectations… I’m here to program.”\n\n0:09:06.180,0:09:10.240\nHas anybody heard this affirmation at some point? \nYes? Good.\n\n0:09:10.240,0:09:13.820\nAgain: this person doesn’t get it. Right?\n\n0:09:13.820,0:09:22.160\nBeware: technical expertise and having people that know how to program is the core of an Agile software development team.There’s no doubt about it.\n\n0:09:22.160,0:09:28.660\nIf we don’t have people who know what they are talking about technically and that use Agile software development practices,\n\n0:09:28.660,0:09:35.560\nas opposed to Agile management,  we’ll never be able to accomplish what Scrum promises us in terms of delivering working software at the end of each sprint,\n\n0:09:35.560,0:09:40.340\nor the ability to tweak software as we please to adapt it to the client’s needs.\n\n0:09:40.340,0:09:51.980\nThat benefit that Scrum sells and that we all have sold by advocating for Scrum cannot be accomplished if we don’t have software developers who are good at Agile software development practices.\n\n0:09:51.980,0:09:56.760\nBut that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t consider the client’s expectations. That’s just wrong.\n\n0:09:56.760,0:10:02.180\nThis is, again, another symptom that the team is going the wrong way.\n\n0:10:02.180,0:10:09.260\nNow: What treatment or cure is there for Zombieism?\n\n0:10:09.260,0:10:13.040\nWell, we can do several things. \nFirst of all, we can try talking to the team.\n\n0:10:13.040,0:10:23.240\nMany times, by facing the team and showing them these issues, they are able to realize those issues and can start healing themselves.\n\n0:10:23.240,0:10:29.380\nIn other cases, one thing that can be done is introducing healthy team members to the team that is turning into a zombie team.\n\n0:10:29.380,0:10:38.160\nWith the goal of getting that heart beating again. A sort of CPR, so that they start flowing again.\n\n0:10:38.160,0:10:43.540\nThe other thing we can do is resort to the community.\n\n0:10:43.540,0:10:52.540\nThere are many studies and activities that have been tested within zombie teams where they have succeeded in resuscitating them and get their heart beating.\n\n0:10:52.540,0:10:58.840\nFor example, Zombie Scrum Resistance is a blog with a series of case studies you can turn to.\n\n0:10:58.840,0:11:06.620\nAnd my personal favorite, which is to stir the waters. Meaning, to somehow shake the team back into life.\n\n0:11:06.620,0:11:15.280\nWe can do this through retrospectives.\nThere’s some things like what I mentioned today about seeing the bigger picture and then translating that to concrete actions.\n\n0:11:15.280,0:11:24.000\nAnother one is “Smell-o-meter”, which implies building a smell-scale of sorts within the company. Things that smell good, things that smell bad.\n\n0:11:24.000,0:11:27.900\nThe author illustrates is rather well with that phrase.\n\n0:11:27.900,0:11:34.500\nAnother thing we can do is change the sprint duration. You might think: “That is a weird thing to do in Scrum. You don’t mess with sprint duration”.\n\n0:11:34.500,0:11:39.900\nIt isn’t messed with mainly due to metrics. \nBut here we are in the presence of a team that doesn’t generate value and fails to achieve a great number of things.\n\n0:11:39.900,0:11:46.680\nAltering the sprint duration in this case will work to stir the waters and make the team come back to life.\n\n0:11:46.680,0:11:56.240\nStarting each daily meeting with a recap of the sprint’s goal, which will force us to come up with a sprint goal in the planning meeting, which is good to have.\n\n0:11:56.240,0:12:02.220\nThese are all things we can do to wake this team up and for them to stop being a zombie team.\n\n0:12:02.220,0:12:08.160\nDo we all agree? Great, this is it for our zombie friends.\n\n0:12:08.160,0:12:10.720\nLet’s move on and talk about our friends the Orcs now.\n\n0:12:10.720,0:12:15.860\nWhat are Orcs?\nWhat would be the technical definition of an Orc?\n\n0:12:15.860,0:12:27.200\nOrcs used to be beautiful beings. \nBut an evil force took them and turned them into these ugly, dirty beings we see on screen.\n\n0:12:27.200,0:12:40.500\nThese evil forces are usually more intelligent forces.\nAnd what they do is create these orcs for their own benefit.\n\n0:12:40.500,0:12:52.520\nAs they don’t want the orcs to rebel, what they do is reduce their intelligence so that they require strength in numbers to reach their goals, much like zombies.\n\n0:12:52.520,0:12:57.980\nThey are usually used as cannon fodder for the benefit of this evil mind that creates them.\n\n0:12:57.980,0:13:02.000\nSo far, that’s the definition of what an Orc is.\n\n0:13:02.000,0:13:08.020\nNow again: What does an orc have to do with a Scrum team?\n\n0:13:08.020,0:13:18.400\nBefore we dive into the definition of an Orc Scrum team, let’s analyze a short phrase to get started on the topic.\n\n0:13:18.400,0:13:22.720\nThere are some authors that say that “Scrum is the new Waterfall”.\n\n0:13:22.720,0:13:29.160\nI prefer the phrase that says “Scrum is the new black”.\nDo you know this phrase? Do you know where it comes from?\n\n0:13:29.160,0:13:39.700\nIn the fashion world, when somebody says that something is the new black, they are saying that that thing, for whatever reason, or lack thereof, became fashionable.\n\n0:13:39.700,0:13:48.120\nSo if somebody says “This summer, lettuce green will be the new black”, we all start wearing lettuce green without any sort of explanation. Right?\n\n0:13:48.120,0:14:00.800\nSo my point here, and I brought this because I like the relation the the fashion industry, is that to me, “Scrum is the new black” means that Scrum became so popular because Scrum is a fad.\n\n0:14:00.800,0:14:06.640\nAnd there is some reason for it to be fashionable, which we will analyze shortly. Why?\n\n0:14:06.640,0:14:17.680\nThere are a lot of managers of companies with a typical pyramid hierarchy who, when pressured by their environment, need to be agile and need to prove they are agile.\n\n0:14:17.680,0:14:23.700\nOr appear to be agile.\nAnd Scrum is a perfect framework for this.\n\n0:14:23.700,0:14:33.380\nBecause Scrum is a framework that does not guarantee results within Agile software development in the software industry.\n\n0:14:33.380,0:14:42.060\nRemember: Scrum is a framework, a container for developing anything in an Agile way.\n\n0:14:42.060,0:14:50.860\nBut for it to work, to develop Agile software, it must be paired with Agile software development practices.\n\n0:14:50.860,0:15:06.740\nSo many of these managers take Scrum, modify it, add and remove things from it, and showcase a false Agilism to the outside world.\n\n0:15:06.740,0:15:12.680\nThat’s why I like this phrase. Because Scrum is something that has become fashionable for different reasons.\n\n0:15:12.680,0:15:20.060\nRight? Good, now you can wake back up, and let’s return to the topic of Orcs to see what’s the deal there.\n\n0:15:20.060,0:15:23.860\nWhat is an Orc Scrum team?\n\n0:15:23.860,0:15:31.380\nWell, precisely, these evil characters that took beautiful beings and turned them into the orcs we spoke about in the definition\n\n0:15:31.380,0:15:42.480\nare those managers that take a healthy team, make alterations to it, they impose Scrum on them,\n\n0:15:42.480,0:15:48.160\nand ultimately turn them into something that appears to be Agile but is not.\n\n0:15:48.160,0:15:54.500\nAs I see you’re still not fully grasping the idea, let’s look at some examples or symptoms of this, like we did with the zombies.\n\n0:15:54.500,0:15:57.400\nSo let’s look at some symptoms.\n\n0:15:57.400,0:16:05.000\nAgain, I took the liberty to do a Google search for what an Orc might sound like and be able to spell it. \nThis is the best I came up with.\n\n0:16:05.000,0:16:10.820\nPlease tell me: How many of you go to retrospective meetings with your laptops?\n\n0:16:10.820,0:16:12.900\nI see some of you laughing in the audience.\n\n0:16:12.900,0:16:25.740\nHow many of you, within your daily meetings, report to a product manager or scrum master who also happens to be your boss?\n\n0:16:25.740,0:16:35.400\nHow many of you have a PM who assigns tasks to each of the Scrum team members?\n\n0:16:35.400,0:16:46.280\nOr worse, how many of you have a PM who does the planning based on his expert judgement, then distributes the tasks, and expects us to reach the goals or scope they established?\n\n0:16:46.280,0:16:54.360\nDo any of these sound familiar?\nIf it does sound familiar, you may be a part of an Orc Scrum team, and not be aware of it.\n\n0:16:54.360,0:17:02.260\nLet’s look at some other examples or symptoms.\nThis is from a manager’s perspective, right?\nSo a manager says:\n\n0:17:02.260,0:17:09.120\n“Ok, I will be the Product Owner. You (sub-manager) will be the Scrum Master. We will have two-week long iterations, planning, dailies.\n\n0:17:09.120,0:17:16.740\nAnd on the last Friday what we’ll do is the team will show me what they have done, and then they’ll do a short retrospective. And that’s it. We are now Agile”.\n\n0:17:16.740,0:17:24.840\nAnd from an outside perspective, you have the ceremonies, you have the roles. Why wouldn’t we consider it a Scrum team? Right?\n\n0:17:24.840,0:17:31.340\nBut clearly, this Scrum team is a long way from really having what a real Scrum should have.\n\n0:17:31.340,0:17:46.100\nCreating value in each sprint. Creating trust. That the software can adapt and support changes from one sprint to the next, and so on.\n\n0:17:46.100,0:17:51.320\nRemember that Scrum is a container. I’ll keep repeating this.\n\n0:17:51.320,0:17:54.260\nLet’s look at another example, another symptom.\n\n0:17:54.260,0:18:04.160\n“We’ve spent the past two months defining the new Agile process. I think that now that we’re finished, it’s ready and we can implement it in the company”.\n\n0:18:04.160,0:18:13.540\nOpen parenthesis: The company this person is speaking about ranges from two to fifty people. It has teams of two people, teams of three people, teams of five… All the way to fifty people.\n\n0:18:13.540,0:18:27.760\nNow: Two months defining an Agile process? \nTwo months for an Agile process to mature, which we know we will not be able to adapt to such disparate teams?\n\n0:18:27.760,0:18:33.980\nPut them to work from day one!\nLet the team itself be the one who generates that process on the go.\n\n0:18:33.980,0:18:43.160\nAnd at the end of two months - four iterations - you won’t have just one process. You will have five, or ten. One process for each team. But that is aligned to each team.\n\n0:18:43.160,0:18:54.700\nWhere the team understands what they’re talking about, and are already creating value.This is clearly also a symptom that the team is turning into an Orc team.\n\n0:18:54.700,0:19:01.720\nLook at these other symptoms.\nImagine a meeting around a large round table.\n\n0:19:01.720,0:19:08.040\n“Ok people, we need to be Agile. Any ideas?”.\nAnd from the bottom of the room, a hand is raised and the person says “Scrum?”.\n\n0:19:08.040,0:19:17.220\nAfter which, what tends to happen is the team camouflages what they’ve been doing so far. They camouflage the same activities and roles they used to have by using Agile terms.\n\n0:19:17.220,0:19:20.560\nAnd there you have it. They are now Agile.\nRight?\n\n0:19:20.560,0:19:27.540\nAgain: This tends to happen, and it doesn’t represent the spirit of Agilism.\n\n0:19:27.540,0:19:34.560\nOne last symptom. A Product Manager or Scrum Master within a retrospective meeting says:\n\n0:19:34.560,0:19:46.320\n“People, we hired you to be intelligent and self-manage. You should be able to organize yourselves. You’re already behind schedule! We need more functionalities, not more tests!”\n\n0:19:46.320,0:19:52.440\nWho hasn’t this happened to? Do you find it familiar?\nWell, good.\n\n0:19:52.440,0:19:59.100\nAgain: A person that says this doesn’t understand anything about creating and developing software and creating value sprint after sprint.\n\n0:19:59.100,0:20:09.600\nHow could I be able to create value or deliver new functionalities to the client in the following sprint if I well may be breaking the ones I delivered in the previous sprint?\n\n0:20:09.600,0:20:15.940\nIn fact, I don’t even know if I finished a functionality if I don’t have a way to test it.\n\n0:20:15.940,0:20:29.660\nComing back to the idea of Scrum as a container:\nOne of the areas in which Scrum is weak is in being able to ensure the use of Agile software development practices.\n\n0:20:29.660,0:20:37.040\nScrum doesn’t tell you how to do things. It tells you that you have to hand over a deliverable at the end of each sprint. But it doesn’t tell you how to do it.\n\n0:20:37.040,0:20:49.540\nThat’s why we need to inject Agile software development practices in order to achieve our goals, which we’ll discuss further towards the end of our talk.\n\n0:20:49.540,0:20:55.480\nAnd as sprints go by, the goal is for our software to remain stable and working.\n\n0:20:55.480,0:20:59.560\nThat the value we deliver to the client is real value as opposed to something that only lasts for one sprint.\n\n0:20:59.560,0:21:10.560\nDo we agree? Good. Let’s now analyze the treatment we can apply to Orc teams.\n\n0:21:10.560,0:21:23.020\nWell, what can we do with these teams?\nUnfortunately, “Orcism” - to give it a term - is incurable.  It’s not like Zombeism, which can be cured. There is no way back from this.\n\n0:21:23.020,0:21:31.160\nWhat people who have belonged to Orc teams can try to do is improve their condition, have the best time they can,\n\n0:21:31.160,0:21:37.720\nand know that they will not revert to those beautiful beings they started as. And they will have some scars.\n\n0:21:37.720,0:21:44.500\nBut what they can do is try to come closer to the idea of Agilism and ask themselves:\n\n0:21:44.500,0:21:51.800\n“Can we contact the clients and the people that create the value for the product we’re developing?\n\n0:21:51.800,0:21:57.080\nCan we think more in terms of product and not so much in terms of process?”\n\n0:21:57.080,0:22:05.260\nAnother thing we can do and that is totally up to us is getting better at Agile software development practices. That’s totally up to us to do.\n\n0:22:05.260,0:22:19.340\nWe can start implementing practices such as TDD, Extreme Programming. Pair programming can be one of those practices.\n\n0:22:19.340,0:22:25.780\nMeaning, there is a set of Agile software development practices that have stood the test of time and can be used.\n\n0:22:25.780,0:22:34.980\nThese have been tested and there have been experiments that show their positive results. So those are up to us to implement. We can use them. Right?\n\n0:22:34.980,0:22:42.140\nWe can also follow Jeffries advice, who says that what we can do is finish one, two or three stories.\n\n0:22:42.140,0:22:48.300\nThen take the abuse for not having finished everything that was planned for the sprint.\n\n0:22:48.300,0:22:58.280\nAnd in the next planning meeting, try to start from the reality we are showing and living as opposed to a fantasy that could never have been achieved from the get-go.\n\n0:22:58.280,0:23:07.100\nMeaning: “Look, we can do two, three, four full functionalities that are tested and integrated, and that don’t break anything. If you want ten, it cannot be done”.\n\n0:23:07.100,0:23:14.940\nSo, within a planning meeting, show the reality as it is, and not a fantasy. Right?\n\n0:23:14.940,0:23:18.060\nJeffries says this in his own words: He says he has been in that situation.\n\n0:23:18.060,0:23:26.680\nAnd that instead of doing what one would do, which is running away from a certain situation or a certain company, one should try to hold their ground, do things right,\n\n0:23:26.680,0:23:33.120\ndevelop and work in a professional manner, do a good job and keep it visible, working and tested.\n\n0:23:33.120,0:23:41.800\nAnd then try to make people see reality for what it is. Right? Good.\n\n0:23:41.800,0:23:46.540\nSome final notes in regards to Agilism.\n\n0:23:46.540,0:23:59.220\nAnd I’ll come back to the concept of Scrum as an empty container that we need to fill with good practices to be able to deliver. Right?\n\n0:23:59.220,0:24:08.940\nBefore we dive into that, let’s see what some reputable authors think. People that signed the Agile Manifesto back in its origins.\n\n0:24:08.940,0:24:15.300\nLet’s see what they say about the current state of Agilism.\n\n0:24:15.300,0:24:21.500\nRon Jeffries says that developers must abandon Agile methods with given names.\n\n0:24:21.520,0:24:32.480\nWhat he is conveying - although the title looks to shake up the community - is that we should try to come closer to what is the Agile Manifesto\n\n0:24:32.500,0:24:41.780\nand stop consuming “packaged methodologies” where we basically follow the manual. Right?\n\n0:24:41.780,0:24:51.180\nNow, earlier today we spoke against “cherry-picking” Scrum activities because that turns us into zombies. And now I’m saying not to follow the manual because it’s also wrong. So what gives?\n\n0:24:51.180,0:24:55.480\nThe problem is that there are authors that state that there is no hope for Scrum anymore.\n\n0:24:55.480,0:25:06.480\nIt’s over. Scrum started to become a sort of a foul word and there are lots of people across the globe who disagree with Scrum given what it has turned into.\n\n0:25:06.480,0:25:12.600\nFor what we were saying earlier. That it became a fad and started to be used to create these Orc teams. Right?\n\n0:25:12.600,0:25:20.540\nFor example, Fowler says one of our main problems as an Agile community is that we need to try to find the “Industrial Complex”.\n\n0:25:20.540,0:25:29.220\nMeaning, the whole business that was created around the sale of Agile services: consulting, books, certifications.\n\n0:25:29.240,0:25:37.280\nThis is one of the main problems that have to be dealt with. And it’s somewhat related to these given name methodologies.\n\n0:25:37.280,0:25:53.580\nThe second problem Fowler speaks of is what I’ve been talking about so far. And that is that there is a lack of recognition for technical skills within the Scrum community. Within Agilism in general.\n\n0:25:53.580,0:26:01.740\nOne trend that is going on is that in different Agile conferences, less and less software developers are attending them,\n\n0:26:01.740,0:26:16.980\nand there’s more attendance from managers, PMs, Scrum Masters and people who don’t really have the ability to create software that is compliant with what we are selling and promising.\n\n0:26:16.980,0:26:30.480\nAt first, it was developers who encouraged Agilism. And in fact, if one reads the first books on Agile, they will notice that the case studies which were successes were lead by this kind of people.\n\n0:26:30.480,0:26:40.900\nPeople who were and are really good developers and who write code every day. Raise your hand if you write code every day?\n\n0:26:40.900,0:26:46.320\nThere are many of you here. But maybe half aren’t raising their hands nowadays.\n\n0:26:46.320,0:26:54.520\nThis - and there’s more people here who do it than I would have thought - is happening within the different communities related to software engineering.\n\n0:26:54.520,0:27:07.100\nThere are lots of people talking about how to create software and less people in that group who actually write code and ensure that the product complies with the Agile philosophy.\n\n0:27:07.100,0:27:10.840\nWho implement Agile software development practices.\n\n0:27:10.840,0:27:21.460\nOn this note, Robert C. Martin says that there are technical foundations - like TDD and many others - that are being left out of Scrum Certifications.\n\n0:27:21.460,0:27:32.760\nThat is why the community is asking, in a way, that we return to the Agile Manifesto and that we abandon those practices that have a first and last name.\n\n0:27:32.760,0:27:38.620\nRight? Good.\nAs we’re short on time we’ll continue with another topic.\n\n0:27:38.620,0:27:44.760\nYes? Great.\nLet’s continue.\n\n0:27:44.760,0:27:50.520\nThe first thing Fowler says is related to what we discussed about the Orcs.\n\n0:27:50.540,0:28:01.580\nThere are many things that are done and sold as Agile when they aren’t really Agile. Fowler spoke about this at a conference last year where he introduced this problem.\n\n0:28:01.580,0:28:09.140\nThe main problem is not filling room with people that want to consume and learn about Agilism.\n\n0:28:09.140,0:28:19.720\nThe main battle is getting those people to then implement Agile software development practices.\n\n0:28:19.720,0:28:22.560\nAnd for them to really believe in the Agile philosophy. And for them to be Agile.\n\n0:28:22.560,0:28:29.280\nSo Fowler got asked which of the four Agile principles was the most important to him.\n\n0:28:29.280,0:28:33.920\nHe had never thought about which one was the most important one, but if he had to define one it would be:\n\n0:28:33.920,0:28:38.000\nInteractions and individuals above processes\nand tools.\n\n0:28:38.000,0:28:41.920\nAnd notice how in today’s talk we’ve spent\nthe whole time talking about processes.\n\n0:28:41.920,0:28:45.420\nInstead of talking about interactions and\nindividuals.\n\n0:28:45.420,0:28:46.820\nDo we agree?\n\n0:28:46.820,0:28:49.240\nScrum is about processes.\n\n0:28:49.240,0:28:52.560\nWe all know that. And as you said, you all know what Scrum is.\n\n0:28:52.560,0:28:57.600\nWhat we need now is \nto really start injecting Agile software development\n\n0:28:57.600,0:29:08.180\npractices to those teams so that \nthey ultimately become real value creators for the client. Right?\n\n0:29:08.180,0:29:11.840\nAny doubts? Questions?\n\n0:29:11.840,0:29:13.560\nWe can discuss during the break over a coffee.\n\n0:29:13.560,0:29:16.340\nOr you can send me your questions via email\nto continue the discussion.\n\n0:29:16.340,0:29:22.100\nIt’s been a pleasure talking with you, and\nhappy to help.\n</pre>\n","related_images":[{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-0.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-1.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-2.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-3.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-4.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-5.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-6.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-7.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-8.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-9.jpg"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-media1.png"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-media2.png"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-media3.png"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-media4.png"},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-media5.png"}],"attachments":[{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019.pdf","description":"This was the slide deck used in the conference."},{"filename":"z-nd-o-jis-uy-2019-agenda.png","description":"This is the original jis.uy website with the agenda."}],"related_topics":[{"title":"Scrum Zombies & Orcs teams","click_bait":"Discussion about these two kind of Scrum Teams: Zombies & Orcs","linkto":"/scrum-zombies-and-orcs-teams"}],"projects":"<h3><a name=\"agenda\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"agenda\" href=\"#agenda\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Agenda</a></h3>\n<p>14:30 pm - Bienvenida <br />\nDiego Vallespir y Martin Solari</p>\n<p>14:50 pm - <strong>Agile practices for software acquisition in critical contexts</strong> <br />\n<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S3KDFHEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Forrest Shull</a> - <a href=\"https://www.sei.cmu.edu/\">Software Engineering Institute</a> <br />\n<em>While Agile and DevOps software methods are hardly new concepts, their application in specialized contexts may in fact require new thinking and innovative methods of tailoring. Moving organizations to adopt Agile methods for the acquisition of systems with safety- and/or security-critical constraints can be an exciting but daunting undertaking, requiring significant effort on both technical issues as well as organizational change ones. An important goal is to obtain the desired benefits of new approaches (e.g. speed to delivery) along with existing aspects that can’t be left behind (e.g. the engineering rigor needed to develop safe and secure software with confidence). In this talk, I draw from experiences in this area to explore questions related to the interplay of research and practice. How much can prior software research work influence large-scale decisions related to software practice? “Do we trust or do we know” regarding the effects of decisions that have to be made and will have significant practical repercussions? And, can new research help fill in gaps in our knowledge, at the right speed to be relevant?</em></p>\n<p>15:30 pm - <strong>Zombie &amp; Orc Scrum teams</strong> <br />\n<a href=\"/\">Darío Macchi</a> - <a href=\"https://www.vairix.com/\">VAIRIX Software Development</a> <br />\n<em>Scrum teams must be win-win for clients and developers.

The magic is obvious: happier customers, earlier initial results, quicker reaction to changes, greater autonomy and personal satisfaction, but how is this possible?

Who orders and controls the execution of the tasks? In this talk we will discuss the choices and mechanisms that precede and make it possible for agile methods to work and what are the consequences of not conforming to them. This conversation is especially relevant given that few organizations use the methods as recommended by their creators and, if due to the business context or idiosyncrasy, we move away from their premises without replacing them with adequate means, we expose ourselves to failure.</em></p>\n<p>17:00 pm - <strong>Break</strong></p>\n<p>17:30 pm - <strong>Perspectivas del desarrollo del software en el mundo de hoy. &quot;No te gusta la sopa: diagrama de Gantt&quot;</strong>\n<a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuela_da_Silveira\">Manuela Da Silveira</a></p>\n<p>18:00 pm - <strong>Gestionar un proyecto de IS con Agile/Scrum en el Estado Uruguayo: ¿es posible?</strong>\n<a href=\"https://uy.linkedin.com/in/gabrielledesma\">Gabriel Fabián Ledesma</a> - <a href=\"https://www.wyeworks.com/\">WyeWorks</a> <br />\n<em>The main objective of this talk is to share the experience of a project managed with Agile methodologies in the Banco de Previsión Social del Uruguay and how during that project the following questions were solved: How were the requirements solved?

On the one hand we gave editorial teams the tools to do their content-generating job following custom workflows; on the other, we delivered content through several channels (vix.com website, Instant Article, Google Accelerated Mobile Pages, and several feeds to social networks and devices). Also, I helped in requirement gathering, QA and progress tracking to ensure the completion of company milestones.</p>\n<p><picture>\n              <source srcset=\"/assets/retros.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n  \n              <img src=\"/assets/retros.jpg#center\" alt=\"Some of our retrospectives\"></picture></p>\n<h3><a name=\"node-js-architect\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"node-js-architect\" href=\"#node-js-architect\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Node.js Architect</a></h3>\n<p>After a year and a half I proposed the idea of making a net of Node.js microservices to split the content delivery from the editorial workflow. Before this, they had a single heavily-customized Drupal that supported all the editorial workflow (~150 copywriters and writers) and the content consumption of ~80.000.000 monthly visits. I was in charge of the design, implementation and management (using Scrum) of that project for about a year, slowly replacing the old implementation of each distribution channels (i.e. Google AMP, Facebook Instant Articles, msn.com, Google News) with new ones. We did it without a significant loss of visits, increasing time on page and reducing bounce rate. Also we increased the rendering times (increasing the gains of the company) but also reduced the DevOps complexity and cost because it support ~25 requests/sec using only one service with 5 instances of them running, coordinated by <a href=\"https://pm2.keymetrics.io/\">PM2</a> process manager with an NGINX as reverse proxy supporting ~1000 req/sec. We also reduced the time to add new channels from an average of two week to 8 hours. From that project we built 2 frameworks/tools (<a href=\"/eajp-enhanced-article-json-parser\">Enhanced Article-JSON Parser</a> and <a href=\"/traceability-logger\">Traceability Logger</a>) plus the <a href=\"/content-distribution-system\">microservices solution itself</a>, that was extensible (as a framework) by design.</p>\n<p>Vix was headquartered in Miami, Florida with offices in New York, Mexico City, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, and Sao Paulo. I had constant interaction with nearly all of the editorial offices of each city, the AdOps team at Sao Paulo, the teams specialized in Analytics at Buenos Aires. Also we worked very near the DevOps team geographically distributed between Uruguay to Belarus.</p>\n","projects":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/content-distribution-system\">Content distribution system - NodeJS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eajp-enhanced-article-json-parser\">Enhanced Article-JSON Parser</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/traceability-logger\">Traceability Logger</a></li>\n</ul>\n"},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/experience/vix-scrum-master-project-manager.dmd","slug":"vix-scrum-master-project-manager","fdate":"March 23rd 2019","outputFilename":"vix-scrum-master-project-manager.html","links":["https://pm2.keymetrics.io/","/eajp-enhanced-article-json-parser","/traceability-logger","/content-distribution-system"]},"backlinks":[{"backlink":"/agile-profile","title":"My agile profile"}],"index":83,"total":154,"isFirst":false,"isLast":false},

My talk representing VAIRIX was done in the section &quot;Innovation and Entrepreneurship in LATAM countries: international guests&quot;.</p>\n<p>The experience of being in Medellín is always a pleasure in all senses. People are great, the city is awesome and most important, you feel the innovation and the desire to improve the city in every person you came across.

Related with InnovaPortal, we develop a user-level course as well as a manual to guide them in the use of the tool.</p>\n<p>Also I worked with a medical visitor management system that let them register what they have been sold in <strong>HP-Jornada 720</strong> portable equipment (also in <strong>HP IPAQ-2210</strong>) and developed in Embedded <strong>Visual Basic 3.0</strong>, <strong>Visual Basic 6.0</strong> and <strong>SQL Server</strong>.</p>\n<p>During the time where I worked at InnovaAge I proved my knowledge in the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Java, Java Servlets, Javascript</strong>.</li>\n<li>Web servers web and application servers (<strong>Apache</strong>, <strong>Tomcat</strong>, <strong>Jetty</strong>, <strong>JBOSS</strong>, <strong>JRun</strong>, <strong>IIS</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Visual Studio 6.0</strong>, <strong>Embedded Visual Studio</strong>, <strong>.Net</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>SQLServer</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Windows 9x</strong>, <strong>Windows 2000</strong>, <strong>Windows XP</strong>, <strong>Mandrake</strong>, <strong>SuSE</strong>, <strong>RedHat</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>MySQL</strong> Front, <strong>WebSphere</strong>, <strong>Visual Age</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The working method followed for many of the projects described above were as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requirement elicitation either through meetings with stakeholders or through <strong>JADs</strong> with them.</li>\n<li>Use of static <strong>HTML prototypes</strong> to simulate the real system and evaluate the acceptability of the client taking it for the develop of the solution.</li>\n<li>Management of changes requested by the different stakeholders involved through identified tickets which made possible the trace of the requests.</li>\n<li>Classes and variables names in English, taking care of <strong>simplicity</strong> and considering the <strong>maintainability</strong> of systems.</li>\n<li>Documentation of the source code in a clear and short way.</li>\n<li>Very close relationship with customers so they felt treated in a personalized way.</li>\n</ul>\n","projects":"<ul>\n<li>Maintenance of <strong>CMVisit</strong> that is a medical visitors management system that let them register their sells in a <strong>HP-Jornada 720</strong> portable equipment.

These are the different tasks performed during this period: Publication of virtual goods, retail, sales, promotions, online sweepstakes sales, sending video greetings from customers, telephone support staff of the shopping malls, email support. Those portals use <strong>JRun 4</strong> as a web server and application server.

Some adjustments on the original product were made being the most notable the change of platform from the <strong>HP-Jornada 720</strong> to the <strong>HP IPAQ-2210</strong>.\nThe system had a replication mechanism to synchronize the mobile device with the server but should be used in a PC with the cradle.\nFor this project I implement a system for remote replication, which allows the pharmaceutical sales people both in Montevideo and the rest of the country replicate information from anywhere via the telephone line. Was also strengthened everything related to business management of the visitors to enhance activities related to sales.\nBesides these activities, we performed data migration from multiple sources to the main database for the purpose of reuse most of the existing information.\nAfter the period of implantation of the device I made an step by step training, which takes place in three <strong>workshops</strong> with different groups of visitors for a week.I also wrote a user manual for the main activities of the mobile software and documentation for the maintenance of the entire system.</li>\n<li>Installation of <strong>Innovaportal</strong> and <strong>Innovanet</strong> at Branaa tannery for the development of their intranet over a <strong>SuSE Linux</strong> platform. <strong>Jetty v.4.2.15</strong> was used as webserver.</li>\n</ul>\n"},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/experience/senior-developer.dmd","slug":"senior-developer","fdate":"July 24th 2017","outputFilename":"senior-developer.html","links":["http://www.montevideoshopping.com.uy","http://www.trescruces.com.uy","http://www.portones.com.uy","http://www.innovaportal.com/","http://www.innovaportal.com/innovaportal/v/16/1/innova.front/innovanet.html","http://www.ghmuruguay.com","http://www.andromaco.com"]},"index":99,"total":154,"isFirst":false,"isLast":false},

This company would be formed if and only if the business plan by the group showed signs of feasibility to the Italian government. My activity during this period included the formation of this group (fourteen people) so they could function in the design, maintenance and management of a website whose main objective would be to promote tourism in Uruguay, without discarding other options.\nThe methodology of the courses was: the issues were downloaded from an institutional website to which each participant accessed through a username and password, then be studied.\nThis study was conducted during the class period (four hours daily) in subgroups according to the profile of each student.\nIn any event, within any topic that was being considered, if there were any doubts, my job was to clear them through examples and classes &quot;fast&quot;. They were quick due to limited time available for each module (as shown in detail below).\nRegarding the examination system, the same were made on-line within the same institutional site which had come down the material.\nNote that this project had a national scope, performing in six different locations throughout the country, which required a great job of coordination and communication among the various subsidiaries.

During the year that last the project, we used <strong>Extreme Programming (XP)</strong> as a methodology being the Coach and <a href=\"/doomsayer\">Doomsayer</a> of the team. Then I applied some of the agile principles and XP practices during my last years at <a href=\"/supervisor---senior-developer---it-consultant\">PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2013-2014 I chose to handle <a href=\"/personal-kanban-with-kanbanize\">every aspect of my life in an agile way</a>, putting everything on a Kanban board using the best tool out there, Kanbanize. Since then, I've kept a close relationship with the bulgarian company, mainly with its CEO. Later I took the design of the tool at that time as the base layout for my personal homepage which is arranged just as a Kanban board (something I called <a href=\"/kanbancv\">KanbanCV</a>).</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"/vairix-coo---scrum-master---researcher\">VAIRIX I worked mainly with scrum</a>. For that reason I did the <a href=\"/certified-scrummaster\">Scrum Master Certification</a> (CSM) with Alan Cyment and later passed the Scrum Alliance exam. Also, and responding to the needs of the company at that time, I designed, developed and carried out an <a href=\"/inception-workshop-for-entrepreneurs\">agile inception workshop</a>. The success of this workshop led me to present it in the <a href=\"/9-entrepreneurship-summer-camp\">Summer Camp on Entrepreneurship</a> in Colombia, in <a href=\"/inception-workshop-on-agiles2015\">Agiles2015</a> in Uruguay and different universities (<a href=\"/introduction-to-the-practice-of-inception\">Universidad ORT Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"/inception-workshop-talk-for-agilists-and-young-entrepreneurs\">Universidad EAFIT - Colombia</a>).</p>\n<p>When I started being a full time <a href=\"/vix-scrum-master-project-manager\">Scrum Master at VIX</a> was when I had time to fully put in practice a lot of ideas with a stable team. I lead them to understand their pains and face them with agile practices. They ended up turning a great Scrum team, divided internally between the backend and the frontend, into a Scrum squad and a Kanban squad built by full-stack devs. The Scrum squad was responsible for the medium and long term goals of the company and features of the product, while the Kanban team was responsible for the daily maintenance activities and bug fixing. Once every two weeks, we came together for a common retrospective and later for a planning meeting (using <a href=\"/dot-voting\">dot voting</a>), where some Scrum squad members replaced the Kanban squad guys for the next two weeks. With the same team base, we did ~65 retrospectives, some of them very ingenious.</p>\n<p><picture>\n              <source srcset=\"/assets/retros.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n  \n              <img src=\"/assets/retros.jpg#center\" alt=\"Some of our retrospectives\"></picture></p>\n<p>Last, but not less important, we did some efforts to add agile practices and principles to other areas of the company. i.e. we promote the use of retrospectives in the editorial area, where each editorial team performed several ones with mixed results.</p>\n<p>Academically, since 2017 I'm teaching <a href=\"/software-engineering-professor\">Agile Software Engineering at Universidad ORT Uruguay</a>. Since 2018 I've been teaching <a href=\"/software-quality-techniques-for-agile-and-traditional-projects\">Software Quality Techniques for agile and traditional projects</a> at Facultad de Ingeniería (FING) - Centro de Posgrados y Actualización Profesional en Informática (CPAP). In this last institution I did a talk named <a href=\"/jis-uy-2019-scrum-zombies-and-orcs-teams\">Scrum Zombies &amp; Orcs teams</a> at JIS2019.

In my role as a final-year project tutor at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I constantly face new challenges, but more than anything, new teams of people. I believe in self-managed teams and feel satisfied knowing that during our time working together, we grew individually and as a team.</p>\n<p>Also, I love coding. My management skills are complemented by in-depth technical knowledge, ranging from defining high-performance architectures (NGINX, PM2, Redis, in-memory or database caches) to the use of backend technologies (JavaScript, Ruby, .Net, Java), databases (MySql, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server), web frameworks (ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails) and frontend ones (JavaScript, React, Handlebars, jQuery, Highcharts JS, SVG).</p>\n<p>Besides this, and perhaps because I am a Software Engineering professor at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I feel very comfortable speaking in public. For this reason, I usually contribute to improving the visibility of the companies where I work by participating in conferences as a speaker, writing articles in blogs and even adding content to Twitter (and other social networks).</p>\n<p>Finally, I am interested in conducting scientific research in the field of Software Engineering to add value to its body of knowledge. At the same time, I want to satisfy some practical needs of the industry, especially those related to quality assurance and decision making. I think it may be helpful to bring tools from the scientific environment closer to the daily activities of software development. In order to achieve this objective and to make a first approximation to the scientific field, I did a Master in Engineering at Universidad ORT Uruguay.</p>\n","related_topics":[{"title":"Doomsayer","click_bait":"Doomsayer: an agile role that describes me","linkto":"/doomsayer"}]},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/me/about-me.dmd","slug":"about-me","fdate":"March 22nd 2017","outputFilename":"about-me.html","links":[]},"index":103,"total":154,"isFirst":false,"isLast":false},

I try to keep it updated, adding content to different sections and features related with personal branding.</p>\n<p>The buiding of this website started on 2012. At that moment I was working with .Net tehcnology so I search for an extensible and easy to learn/deploy CMS. I found <a href=\"https://www.kooboo.com/\">Kooboo</a> and it worked like a charm until 2015.</p>\n<p>In 2015 I was working on a Ruby on Rails company, so to learn more about that technology I started a migration to another CMS based on RoR. I found several CMSs, but one that stood out from the rest was <a href=\"https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa\">ComfortableMexicanSofa</a> (Comfy). With this change of CMS I suffered the content migration, mostly because both tools had very different approaches. At this time I decided that, if in the future I have to do another migration, at least the content would be migrated to an open format, something easy to maintain and port to any technology.</p>\n<p>That moment was on 2017. At that moment I was in charge of a massive content migration project. As a PoC I choose to port my own website to Node.js, but remembering how I suffered with the content last time, I decided to implement a custom content format to fulfill my needs. That is how the dmd format born, a typed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">ini</a> based format, with a json section as front matter and markdown sections (besides other types). Altough initially seems odd, it was destiled from the use of Kooboo and Comfy, taking what I like more from both tools (more about this <a href=\"/static-website-generator\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>I didn't go for a CMS this time. Why? I think web development is living in very confusing times, where trends and fashion clash with common sense. For example, people who use highly reactive web development frameworks to disply almost static information or for administrative websites that don't need any kind of reactivity. These decisions (beside going against common sense) make everything more complex, adding layers of indirections, being more resource intensive and making it more difficult to maintain.</p>\n<p>I'm happy with static html generation, is simple, is enough, is easy to maintain; I can't be happier with my dmd format, because it let me do whatever I want, always keeping in mind the KISS principle.</p>\n"},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/me/finish-this-website.dmd","slug":"finish-this-website","fdate":"May 19th 2017","outputFilename":"finish-this-website.html","links":["https://www.kooboo.com/","https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file","/static-website-generator"]},"backlinks":[{"backlink":"/static-website-generator","title":"Static website generator"}],"index":104,"total":154,"isFirst":false,"isLast":false},

It has a hazelnut accent that reminds me a bit the Frangelico except that the rum is heavier in the mouth, less viscous and of course tastes much more of molasses and caramel.

Users don't really know what they want. Creating products people loves requires treating product development as an art, not a science; but products have to solve real user problems. Understanding impact of product changes to existing product is best done by mining the data. When you have a mature product and many users you have lots of data on how they are using it. Use that data to make evidence-based decisions.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://books.google.com.uy/books/about/Inspired.html?id=nE7NMQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">Inspired: Created Products People Love</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"divide-and-conquer\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"divide-and-conquer\" href=\"#divide-and-conquer\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Divide and conquer</a></h3>\n<p>Big, hard problems become easy if you cut them into small pieces. How do you eat the elephant? One bite at a time. If a problems seems hard, think about how you can cut it into two smaller, easier problems.

You learned something in the attempt, set it down for a while. Maybe in a few weeks or a few months you (or someone else) will pick it up again and find that the world has changed in a way that makes it the right time to build the thing.</p>\n<p>Corollary: if you don't do what you need/have to do in the right moment, later it won't be effective.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"build-an-audience\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"build-an-audience\" href=\"#build-an-audience\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Build an audience</a></h3>\n<p>I don't know the industry you work in.

All that people will know how good you are so is the <a href=\"http://99u.com/articles/52687/the-most-defensible-thing-you-can-do-for-your-career-build-an-audience\">best job insurance possible</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"don\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"don\" href=\"#don\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Don't interrupt an interruption.</a></h3>\n<p>One thing at a time; as exception you can make 1 interruption, but only 1.

This reminds us that while randomness plays a role in every outcome, our locus of control resides in our day-to-day activities more than in our one-time decisions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/11/stop-worrying-about-making-the-right-decision/\">Stop Worrying About Making the Right Decision</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"machete-design\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"machete-design\" href=\"#machete-design\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Machete design</a></h3>\n<p>Create a single, general-purpose tool which is simple to understand but can be applied to many problems. It's like the product version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\">occam's razor</a>.</p>\n<p>The value of a product is the number of problems it can solve divided by the amount of complexity the user needs to keep in their head to use it. Consider an iPhone vs a standard TV remote: an iPhone touchscreen can be used for countless different functions, but there's very little to remember about how it works (tap, drag, swipe, pinch). With a TV remote you have to remember what every button does; the more things you can use the remote for, the more buttons it has. We want to create iPhones, not TV remotes.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"small-sharp-tools\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"small-sharp-tools\" href=\"#small-sharp-tools\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Small sharp tools</a></h3>\n<p>Composability. Simple tools which do one thing well and can be composed with other tools to create a nearly infinite number of results. For example, the unix methodology (stdin/stdout and pipes), see <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=H4q1t-jAcBIC\">The Art of Unix Programming</a>. Small is beautiful. This isn't just tools, it's also teams. Several small, autonomous, focused teams working in concert almost always beat a single monolithic team.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"results-not-politics\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"results-not-politics\" href=\"#results-not-politics\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Results, not politics</a></h3>\n<p>You &quot;get ahead&quot; in your career by delivering real value to customers and to the company, not by impressing your boss or with big talk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"decision-making-via-ownership-not-consensus-or-authority\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"decision-making-via-ownership-not-consensus-or-authority\" href=\"#decision-making-via-ownership-not-consensus-or-authority\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Decision-making via ownership, not consensus or authority</a></h3>\n<p>Every product, feature, software component, web page, business deal, blog post, and so on should have a single owner. Many people may collaborate on it, but the owner is &quot;the buck stops here&quot; and makes the final call on what happens with the owned thing.</p>\n<p>The owner can and should collect feedback from others, but feedback is just that: input that the owner might or might not choose to incorporate into their work. If something doesn't have an owner, no one should be working on it or trying to make decisions about it. Before those things can happen, it has to be owned.</p>\n<p>Ownership can't be given, only taken. Ownership can't be declared, only demonstrated. Ownership begins with whoever creates the thing first. Later the owner may hand it off to someone else. If an item gets dropped for some reason (for example, the current owner switching teams or leaving the company), it's fair game for anyone else to pick up.</p>\n<p>Apple's term for an owner is <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Apple-Inc-2/How-well-does-Apples-Directly-Responsible-Individual-DRI-model-work-in-practice\">&quot;directly responsible individual,&quot; or DRI</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"do-ocracy-intrapreneurship\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"do-ocracy-intrapreneurship\" href=\"#do-ocracy-intrapreneurship\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Do-ocracy / intrapreneurship</a></h3>\n<p>Ask forgiveness, not permission.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://adam.herokuapp.com/past/2009/7/28/doocracy/\">Do-ocracy</a>\n<ul>\n<li>A do-ocracy is an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them.

That includes discontinuing or shutting down whatever the thing is.

By failing to document the feature before you shipped it? By screwing up a customer's app? By not respecting someone's ownership, or hurting someone's feelings?</p>\n<p>Own it.

Use feature flags to activate people slowly into changes, then let it bake for a bit. Test out the message for a public launch by first sending it around internally, and later writing the private beta announcement. Collect feedback and adjust. By the time you're ready to take it public to a wide audience, you'll be fairly certain to have worked out all the kinks.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=yJXHUDSaJgsC\">Crossing the Chasm</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"do-less\" class=\"anchor\">\n<a name=\"do-less\" href=\"#do-less\" class=\"no_external_ico\">Do less</a></h3>\n<p>Do we really need that feature?

Break it apart.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the hairiest of cases or the rushiest of rushes: make a mental note that it needs to be refactored. Bring it up with your boss. Explain that it would be irresponsible to build further there without some refactoring. If you lack a test harness to do this efficiently, fantastic!

This analysis will be carried out according to calculations of certain indicators/indicators such as NDVI, EVI, LAI, floods, among others.</p>\n<p>In Latin America, the agricultural business (sale of grains and purchase of inputs) of small and medium-sized producers represents 120 billion dollars a year. The continent's wealth is based on agricultural production, as well as on the development and improvement of its productivity. However, within the daily operations that occur in each actor in the chain, there are a great many inefficiencies. Thus, the effect generated by the tools that optimize agricultural management has a very high economic, environmental and social impact.</p>\n<p>Cooperatives, farmers and grain receivers face this problem in their day-to-day operations, since they finance more than 80 percent of producers' activities at very high risk because they have very little information about what is actually happening in the field. Today, they do not have a tool to efficiently analyze this risk.</p>\n<p>In the case of grain recipients (who are often also input suppliers), most of whom are exporters, the challenge is to enter increasingly demanding markets that require information. This information includes the quality of the grain and its sanitary status, but it is increasingly important to provide traceability from the farm, which includes information on all agricultural activities related to the grain.</p>\n<p>Agroindustry, in its day-to-day work, generates a great deal of relevant data for decision-making and management of agribusinesses. However, given current practices, this data is lost because it is collected in &quot;field notebooks&quot; in a parceled form, so it cannot be analyzed and taken advantage of. In terms of digital transformation, agriculture is on the last step.\nIn Uruguay, and probably throughout Latin America, 97% of producers do not record data, do not compare work practices or management in order to improve their performance, and do not analyze the information, which prevents them from learning from their mistakes. However, the 3% that do, are at least 200% more profitable.</p>\n<p>The problem that currently arises is that the records are only provided by the agricultural engineers at the time of going through the fields, who usually only manage to go through the sectors near the roads, preventing the possibility of having a total record of them. Because of this, there is no automatic alert system to minimize the effects of a plague or a specific problem affecting a specific sector of a pasture.</p>\n<p>With the implementation of this project thorugh the reading and interpretation of satellite images, it will be possible to provide a complete analysis, allowing to easily compare the current situation of a crop in comparison to objective indicators and store historical data of it.</p>\n","related_images":[{"filename":"krooping-fabian.png"},{"filename":"krooping-agustina.png"},{"filename":"krooping-joaquin.png"}]},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/project/krooping-procesamiento-de-imágenes-satelitales-para-generación-de-índices-agronómicos.dmd","slug":"krooping-procesamiento-de-imágenes-satelitales-para-generación-de-índices-agronómicos","fdate":"October 30th 2020","outputFilename":"krooping-procesamiento-de-imágenes-satelitales-para-generación-de-índices-agronómicos.html","links":["/degree-final-projects-tutor"]},"index":114,"total":154,"isFirst":false,"isLast":false},

Carla is interested in accounting advice and publishes an application. Jorge is a student accountant and offers balance sheet advice at Coopify. Jorge sees Carla's application and offers her services, but is not interested in therapy sessions, so Carla pays Jorge's service for 20 &quot;coopis&quot;.\nIn short, Coopify is a platform with the aim of fostering cooperation within the community. Users can publish their services for a value in &quot;coopis&quot;, negotiate possible exchanges and leave reviews of their experience for future consumers.</p>\n<p>If two users offer services that are of interest to both parties, they can exchange them.

Over the years recommendations have changed, teams and tools have matured, but those changes rarely impact on historical archives.

It is clear the entrepreneur doesn't always have the tools to do this analysis; often neither the development provider has them or just his business is build software and nothing more. So this situation generates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Waste of money because the developed software doesn't meet the entrepreneur needs (or doesn't take into account some technological risks).</li>\n<li>Bad choice of the company that develops the software, maybe because of the ignorance about technical requirements that this provider should meet.</li>\n<li>Products that aren't validated against the market, which delays the success of them, loss of opportunity windows and above all, money.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In contrast, our workshop allows the entrepreneur to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define the list of functions they really need in their software and rank them.</li>\n<li>Discover the technical risks associated with the software they want to build.</li>\n<li>Generate list of skills that the software provider/developer must meet.</li>\n<li>Build a validation plan for their business in stages (proportionally with their investment possibilities) toward the final product.</li>\n<li>Get an initial idea of the required volume of work to develop the software (the estimation translates to possible cost ranges).</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 470px; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>The workshop is held with the team responsible for the entrepreneurship (1-6 people max.) and can be done remotely or in person.

These outputs will be write down in a collaborative way (between all the participants) in a document accessible from the first day.</p>\n<p>Out of the workshop hours, the participants may discuss the activities carried out, get additional information and maturate concepts which then can be added to the document.

The physiological variable were taken to determine the movement restrictions. Then use graph theory to determine a single interpretation of the data.</p>\n<p>Robert Holt <strong>[3]</strong> adopted the technique of Divide &amp; Conquer to decompose each articulated object into primitive (rigid or articulated), estimating the motion of these simple parts. Decompositions and estimates then spread to the body recursively. This solution does not exploits the fact that parts belong to the same individual and are interrelated.</p>\n<p>Xiaoming Liu <strong>[4]</strong> used the correspondence between the 3D model and 2D image to calibrate the camera and to construct a sequence of movements in 3D perspective. The effectiveness of the model has yet to be tested in random positions of the body, especially those in which the triangle formed by the shoulders and chest are melted.</p>\n<p>Camillo J. Taylor <strong>[5]</strong> does not assume that the images are taken with a calibrated camera which means that the system can be used in photos obtained from the web or scanned. The method assumes that the relationship between points of the scene and its corresponding image can be modeled as a scale orthographic projection. Not suitable for use in situations where there are significant perspective effects. It also requires the user to specify which segment is the closest to the camera.</p>\n<p>The novelty of the approach proposed by Zhao and Li is based on a hierarchical model for the reconstruction of human body posture based on images captured using a single camera. Was decided to explore this last solution because of the various problems presented earlier. We also managed to contact the project leaders who provided additional information to that found on the web.</p>\n<p>This model uses a human skeleton with encoded biomechanical constraints on the various joints.</p>\n<p>The angular change of the joints in the same coordinate system is obtained between consecutive segments in a hierarchical manner through matrix transformations.</p>\n<p>The skeleton used contains 17 joints and 16 segments. It is assumed that we have geometric information of the individual (eg. length of each body segment).</p>\n<p>The body can be represented as a tree of rigid parts connected by specific joints. Each rigid part is allowed to move freely in their own domain on its immediate ancestor.</p>\n<div class=\"table-container\">\n  <table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n    <tr>\n      <td><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-1.gif\"></td>\n      <td><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-2.gif\"></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n<p>Each joint has three biomechanical constraints representing the angles of rotation about the axes X, Y, Z in its local coordinate system (a,b,g).</p>\n<p>Biomechanical constraints are important to construct the model since it decreases the solution space, but is not sufficient to determine the exact position of the body. For these reason we will user the concept of &quot;Criterion function&quot;.</p>\n<p>To define this concept will use the following notation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>segment_img<sub>i</sub> is the vector representing the body segment i in the 2D image.</li>\n<li>segment_proj<sub>i</sub> is the vector representing the projection of segment i in the 3D model.</li>\n<li>position_img<sub>i</sub> is joint position i in the 2D image.</li>\n<li>position_proj<sub>i</sub> is joint position i in the 3D model.</li>\n<li>Delta_scale is an array of weight parameters.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-3.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-3.gif\"></picture></li>\n<li><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-4.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-4.gif\"></picture></li>\n<li><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-5.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-5.gif\"></picture></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This set of definitions lead to the &quot;Criterion function&quot;:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-6.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-6.gif\"></picture></p>\n<p>where scale (n) are weight parameters that alter the result by segment and the joint on which you are working. Sometimes the movement of a segment or other affected joint so that the formula should be applied to the entire branch of the tree that is affected (may even come to affect the whole tree).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-7.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-7.gif\"></picture></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-8.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-8.gif\"></picture></p>\n<p><strong>Standard ISO/IEC FCD 19774:200X (H-ANIM)</strong></p>\n<p>This standard comes from the need to represent humans in virtual environments via the web. This standard specifies the way of representing humanoids using VRML97.</p>\n<p>The document layout is based on three basic principles are: compatibility, flexibility and simplicity.</p>\n<p>The human body is defined by segments which are connected by hinges. Encourage these humanoid pair simply necessary joints access and alter the angle between the two connecting segments.</p>\n<p>A humanoid is composed of the following objects:</p>\n<p>Humanoid is the root of the body and provides support to other body parts.\nJoint: is related to the root of the body and joints with other objects through objects Segments.\nSegment: Specifies the physical attributes of the connections between the joints.\nSite: Allows you represent items such as clothing, cameras and jewelry on the body.\nDispleasure: this object contains information about the range of motion allowed for the object within which it is located.</p>\n<p>Basically, the standard defines a tree of segments connected by joints that define the set of transformations which move from the root to each of the humanoid body appendages.</p>\n<p>There are different levels of articulation (LOA: Level of Articulation). For example we can define a humanoid with 14 joints (low joint) to a humanoid with 72 joints (high level of articulation).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Because the 3D modeling of the swing was established as an additional project scope, the result of research carried out allow to generate the knowledge needed to begin work on the 2D model.</p>\n<p>As a result of knowledge gained from the analysis of Criterion Function and the h-anim standard we have reached to the following conclusions.</p>\n<p>Generating the 2D model and the various metrics related to the golf swing will strengthen the concepts learned about the structure of the human body and the relationship between its parts. We will also generate a number of general classes and tools to facilitate the work of building the 3D model.</p>\n<p>The 3D model will be generated as an independent module that will communicate in the future with the 2D model via an interface. The idea is generate the 2D model so the resulting information from both, the model and the different metrics, will be stored before being consumed by the 3D model.</p>\n<p>We will try to stay within the standard h-anim as much as possible, especially in the representation of the various parts of the body and the relationship between these.</p>\n<p><strong>[1]</strong> Valentina Filova, France Solina, Jadran Lenarcic, Automatic reconstruction of 3D human arm motion from a monocular image sequence, Machine Vision and Applications (1998) 10, 1998, 223-231.</p>\n<p><strong>[2]</strong> Zen Chen and His-Jian Lee, Knowledge_Guided Visual Perception of 3-D Human Gait from a Single Image Sequence, Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions, Vol. 22, No. 2, March/April 1992, 336-342.</p>\n<p><strong>[3]</strong> Robert J.Holt, Arun N.Netravali, Thomas S.Huang, Richard J.Qian, Determining Articulated Motion from Perspective Views: A Decomposition Approach, IEEE Workshop on Motion of Non-Rigid and Articulated Objects, 1994, 126-137.</p>\n<p><strong>[4]</strong> Xiaoming Liu, Yueting Zhuang, and Yunhe Pan, Video Based Human Animation Technique, Proc. of the 7th ACM International Multimedia Conference, Orlando, Florida, USA, October 30-November 5, 1999.</p>\n<p><strong>[5]</strong> Camillo J.

This was not the case of the application developed by the team where a difference of one frame back or forth, the stages of the swing, angles or paths lead to different code execution.</p>\n<p>One solution posed by the article is the use of &quot;mock objects&quot;, by which we can simulate the environment and the conditions of implementation to test certain features.</p>\n<p>The team began developing a &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object\" title=\"Mock object\">mock object</a>&quot; to test the video playback capabilities trying to simulate the DirectX runtime environment.</p>\n<p>We quickly reached the same conclusion as the author of the article. The &quot;mock objects&quot; never behave exactly like the original, regardless of the effort made.</p>\n<p>Our problem was that DirectX set a serie of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable\" title=\"Environment variable\">environment variables</a> defined by the device, which are not defined when running a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing\" title=\"Unit testing\">unit test</a> by <a href=\"http://www.nunit.org/\" title=\"NUnit\">Nunit</a>.</p>\n<p>We conducted a brief research into that matter, seeing some solutions that add more complexity in the development of each test case than the team was ready to face.</p>\n<p>It fact, the team's idea about TDD is that it is only useful if it make the design tasks more simple and clear. The fact of having to implement major design solutions to develop test cases was rejected by the team.</p>\n<p>Instead it was decided to make checklists with test items to be followed at the end of each iteration, so we will always perform the same tests to ensure proper operation of each functionality.</p>\n<p>WELLER, David 2004.
