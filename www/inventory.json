El objetivo de esta investigación es conocer de qué manera están siendo revisados los distintos artefactos generados durante el proceso de desarrollo de software en Uruguay. Se realiza una encuesta online dirigida a profesionales en desarrollo de software, vinculados a actividades de aseguramiento de calidad o definición de procesos. Los resultados de la encuesta indican que no se utilizan técnicas formales de revisión aunque distintos artefactos de software son revisados mediante técnicas menos formales y sistemáticas (técnicas ad-hoc y revisiones de pares). Respecto a los artefactos, los más revisados son claves para el proceso de desarrollo, de alto riesgo para el éxito del proyecto y de alta visibilidad de cara al usuario. Estos son las especificaciones de requerimientos y documentos de diseño, el código y la interfaz de usuario respectivamente. Dado que el uso de revisiones no formales es amplio, se pueden buscar mejoras en la calidad de dichos procesos adoptando prácticas de técnicas más formales como el uso de técnicas de lectura y herramientas de apoyo a través de la capacitación permanente.</p>\n","more_info":"<p>You can download the full text version from <a href=\"/assets/diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This article was presented at the XVI Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering (CibSE 2013) held in Montevideo, Uruguay on April 9, 2013.</p>\n<p>The Powerpoint file used to that conference can be downloaded <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/dariomac/macchi-cibseis20cibse2013\">here</a>.</p>\n","related_images":[{"filename":"art_cibse2013_1.jpg"},{"filename":"art_cibse2013_2.jpg"},{"filename":"art_cibse2013_3.jpg"}],"attachments":[{"filename":"diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay.pdf","description":"This is my self hosted version of the article."}]},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/article/diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay.dmd","slug":"diagnostico-del-uso-de-tecnicas-de-revision-de-software-en-uruguay","fdate":"March 17th 2017"}},

The main conclusion was that most of the factors causing low adoption are related to developers perceptions about the process, lack of training and some characteristics of the process as the rigidity, complexity and the difficulty of connecting the effort made with the final product quality.

A good friend of mine introduced me to this jewel and then I couldn't abandon it any more.</p>\n<p>On the nose, Jack Daniel's Black Label offers gentle aromas of caramel, vanilla, and butterscotch. A hint of wood is apparent and toffee notes begin to appear in the glass as it opens up.

I find oriental spices, nutmeg, dark molasses, and sweet honey when I smell it. In the mouth is really rich and very very sweet (although it may be too sweet for some). Is more like a rum liqueur than a true rum. It has a hazelnut accent that reminds me a bit the Frangelico except that the rum is heavier in the mouth, less viscous and of course tastes much more of molasses and caramel. I would have to describe this rum as almost honey like in its texture. The flavour stays in the mouth long after the drink is gone, but the throat receives just a gentle burn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/legendario-rum.jpg#center\" alt=\"Legendario Rum's bottle\" /></p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.larosada.com.uy/boutique.php\">Agua Ardiente de Arándanos (Blueberry Schnapps)</a></h2>\n<p>Recently, in a vegetables market in Montevideo, I saw a bottle of this schnapps and I couldn't resist to buy it.</p>\n<p>Inside there is a clear liquid with a light syrup density. On the nose the sweet notes are present as well as fresh blueberry and white flowers appear. On the palate, the attack is sweet, silky and warm, with well integrated alcohol despite its 40°. Staying in mouth is persistent, and that's where the flavors of the fruit skin appear.

Here I introduce myself, write about experiences, education, other activities, just as in a regular resume but with additional information.</p>\n<p>The layout looks as a simple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban\" title=\"Kanban board definition\">kanban board</a> and it's inspired in a very useful tool named <a href=\"http://kanbanize.com\" title=\"Kanbanize.com\">Kanbanize</a>.</p>\n<p>Each section of my resume (represented by a swimlane) shows what I'm planning to do, what I'm doing and what I've done. Traditionally, swimlanes are used to track parallel work streams within a common resource. In this case I'm the common resource used in every parallel work stream (aspect of my life). As in a normal kanban board, the demand of the left columns (e.g the need to finish things, to move forward, to increase experience) pulls items from the right (current activities and plans).</p>\n<p>The &quot;Plan&quot; column of kanban board let you know what may be my &quot;next moves&quot; about each aspect of my life. Here I'll list my education plan, some researches that I want to do, projects, etc. I use it as a motivator because once an activity is place there everybody see it and ask me <em>&quot;when you will do that planned task?&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;So, you are thinking in study ____ right?&quot;</em>. So this is the column that show to where I'm going.</p>\n<p>The &quot;In progress&quot; column let me tell you what I'm doing right now and let you see if some of my planned task go forward and became work in progress. This is my main stream, the place that remember me where am I.</p>\n<p>Finally, &quot;Done&quot; column contains tasks I've done, experiences, generated knowledge, learned lessons and all that stuff that I've collected through years. This is the column that I use to think, to resolve problems, this is the place where I come to find answers and to remember.</p>\n<p>I know that is an uncommon way to present a resume but I feel more confortable with this kind of distribution and I think that show a more complete picture about myself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"index.html\" title=\"Go to KanbanCV\">Enjoy it!</a> or look at some more standard versions of my resume following the footer links.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid; padding: 2px;\">\n  <a style=\"background: none !important;\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\" rel=\"license\">\n    <img src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/88x31.png\" style=\"border-width: 0;\" alt=\"Creative Commons License\">\n  </a><br>\n  <span rel=\"dct:type\" property=\"dct:title\" href=\"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text\" xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\">\n    KanbanCV\n  </span>\n  by\n  <a rel=\"cc:attributionURL\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" href=\"kanbancv.html\" xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\">\n    Darío Macchi\n  </a>\n  is licensed under a\n  <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\" rel=\"license\">\n    Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\n  </a>.<br>\n  Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at\n  <a rel=\"cc:morePermissions\" href=\"ContactMe.html\" xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\">\n    http://www.dariomac.com/ContactMe\n  </a>.\n</p>\n"},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/me/kanbancv.dmd","slug":"kanbancv","fdate":"April 15th 2018"}},

Because of this, I only work in the 20% of things that returns the 80% of benefits (the old Pareto).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><a href=\"#my-values\">My values</a></h2>\n<p>Some of these are borrowed from <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/adamwiggins/5687294\">Adams Wiggins Heroku Values</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#strategy-vs-tactic\">Strategy vs. Tactic</a></h3>\n<p>The difference between strategy and tactics: strategy is done above the shoulders, tactics are done below the shoulders.</p>\n<p>Strategy is the best way we found to choose the best battles to fight in order to win a war; tactic is just the best way we found to win those battles.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#make-it-real\">Make it real</a></h3>\n<p>Ideas are cheap. Make a prototype, draw a wireframe. Discuss around concrete examples, not hand-waving abstractions. Don't say you did something; provide a URL that proves it.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#ship-it\">Ship it</a></h3>\n<p>Nothing is real until it's being used by a real user. This doesn't mean you make a prototype in the morning and blog about it in the evening. It means you find one person you believe your product will help and try to get them to use it.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#do-with-style\">Do it with style</a></h3>\n<p>Just because we're building bad-ass infrastructure and tools doesn't mean it can't be cool, stylish, and fun. Aesthetic matters. See <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=MqdydvbWZgEC\">The Substance of Style</a></p>\n<p>Slick and fun meets powerful and serious.</p>\n<p>Before Heroku (and a few others, like Github and Atlassian), developer-facing products were almost always stodgy, ugly, and completely lacking in style or fun.</p>\n<p>We're part of the <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/t/consumerization-of-it/consumerization-of-it-190132\">consumerization of IT</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#intuition-balance-data\">Intuition-driven balances data-driven</a></h3>\n<p>Hunches guide you to places to create new value in the product. Users don't really know what they want. Creating products people loves requires treating product development as an art, not a science; but products have to solve real user problems. Understanding impact of product changes to existing product is best done by mining the data. When you have a mature product and many users you have lots of data on how they are using it. Use that data to make evidence-based decisions.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=nE7NMQAACAA\">Inspired: Created Products People Love</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#divide-and-conquer\">Divide and conquer</a></h3>\n<p>Big, hard problems become easy if you cut them into small pieces. How do you eat the elephant? One bite at a time. If a problems seems hard, think about how you can cut it into two smaller, easier problems. If one of those problems is still too hard, cut it in half again.</p>\n<p>Wiggins' Law: If it's hard, cut scope.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#timing-matters\">Timing matters</a></h3>\n<p>If you're building something and just can't seem to get it right, maybe now isn't the right time. You learned something in the attempt, set it down for a while. Maybe in a few weeks or a few months you (or someone else) will pick it up again and find that the world has changed in a way that makes it the right time to build the thing.</p>\n<p>Corollary: if you don't do what you need/have to do in the right moment, later it won't be effective.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#build-audience\">Build an audience</a></h3>\n<p>I don't know the industry you work in. But what I do know is that your industry needs your voice. More people than those in the room with you each day deserve to see your take on things that matter. All that people will know how good you are so is the <a href=\"http://99u.com/articles/52687/the-most-defensible-thing-you-can-do-for-your-career-build-an-audience\">best job insurance possible</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#interruptions\">Don't interrupt an interruption.</a></h3>\n<p>One thing at a time; as exception you can make 1 interruption, but only 1. Don't interrupt an interruption. See <a href=\"http://gmarik.info/notes/programming/test-driven-development-kent-beck\">Test Driven Development By Kent Beck</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#good-decisions\">Take a good decision; then ensure that the decision you make turns out right.</a></h3>\n<p>While I support the use of any available data to rank my options in some rough sense, ultimately the best way to avoid paralysis-by-analysis and moving forward is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>paying close attention to the feelings and emotions that accompany the decision we're facing,</li>\n<li>assessing how motivated we are to work toward the success of any given option, and</li>\n<li>recognizing that, no matter what option we choose, our efforts to support its success will be more important than the initial guesswork that led to our choice. This reminds us that while randomness plays a role in every outcome, our locus of control resides in our day-to-day activities more than in our one-time decisions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/11/stop-worrying-about-making-the-right-decision/\">Stop Worrying About Making the Right Decision</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#machete\">Machete design</a></h3>\n<p>Create a single, general-purpose tool which is simple to understand but can be applied to many problems. It's like the product version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor\">occam's razor</a>.</p>\n<p>The value of a product is the number of problems it can solve divided by the amount of complexity the user needs to keep in their head to use it. Consider an iPhone vs a standard TV remote: an iPhone touchscreen can be used for countless different functions, but there's very little to remember about how it works (tap, drag, swipe, pinch). With a TV remote you have to remember what every button does; the more things you can use the remote for, the more buttons it has. We want to create iPhones, not TV remotes.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#small-tools\">Small sharp tools</a></h3>\n<p>Composability. Simple tools which do one thing well and can be composed with other tools to create a nearly infinite number of results. For example, the unix methodology (stdin/stdout and pipes), see <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=H4q1t-jAcBIC\">The Art of Unix Programming</a>. Small is beautiful. This isn't just tools, it's also teams. Several small, autonomous, focused teams working in concert almost always beat a single monolithic team.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#results\">Results, not politics</a></h3>\n<p>You &quot;get ahead&quot; in your career by delivering real value to customers and to the company, not by impressing your boss or with big talk.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#ownership\">Decision-making via ownership, not consensus or authority</a></h3>\n<p>Every product, feature, software component, web page, business deal, blog post, and so on should have a single owner. Many people may collaborate on it, but the owner is &quot;the buck stops here&quot; and makes the final call on what happens with the owned thing.</p>\n<p>The owner can and should collect feedback from others, but feedback is just that: input that the owner might or might not choose to incorporate into their work. If something doesn't have an owner, no one should be working on it or trying to make decisions about it. Before those things can happen, it has to be owned.</p>\n<p>Ownership can't be given, only taken. Ownership can't be declared, only demonstrated. Ownership begins with whoever creates the thing first. Later the owner may hand it off to someone else. If an item gets dropped for some reason (for example, the current owner switching teams or leaving the company), it's fair game for anyone else to pick up.</p>\n<p>Apple's term for an owner is <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Apple-Inc-2/How-well-does-Apples-Directly-Responsible-Individual-DRI-model-work-in-practice\">&quot;directly responsible individual,&quot; or DRI</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#dodocracy\">Do-ocracy / intrapreneurship</a></h3>\n<p>Ask forgiveness, not permission.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://adam.heroku.com/past/2009/7/28/doocracy/\">Do-ocracy</a>\n<ul>\n<li>A do-ocracy is an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them. Responsibilities attach to people who do the work, rather than elected or selected officials. From <a href=\"http://www.communitywiki.org/en/DoOcracy\">DoOcracy on communitywiki.org</a></li>\n<li>Any member who regularly attends meetings can have input in designing, building, operating and playing with the large-scale work that is created. This type of leadership has been coined a Do-ocracy. In short, if one wants to see something happen they take the initiative to do it. From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_Lotus_Girls\">the Wikipedia entry for the Flaming Lotus Girls</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://adam.heroku.com/past/2008/8/10/intrapreneur/\">Intrapreneur</a>: someone who launches new initiatives within an established organization, marshalling resources and taking responsibility for the results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"#everything-is-a-experiment\">Everything is an experiment</a></h3>\n<p>Anything we do -- a product, a feature, a standing meeting, an email campaign -- is always subject to change. That includes discontinuing or shutting down whatever the thing is. Ending an experiment isn't a failure, since we often learn the most from experiments that don't produce the results we wanted.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#own-up-to-failure\">Own up to failure</a></h3>\n<p>Did you make a mistake by posting to the blog at the wrong time? By failing to document the feature before you shipped it? By screwing up a customer's app? By not respecting someone's ownership, or hurting someone's feelings?</p>\n<p>Own it. Admit your mistake, say you're sorry (when applicable), and feel the failure to make sure you learned from it. Then, get back to work.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#gradual-rollouts\">Gradual rollouts</a></h3>\n<p>Ease into everything. Use feature flags to activate people slowly into changes, then let it bake for a bit. Test out the message for a public launch by first sending it around internally, and later writing the private beta announcement. Collect feedback and adjust. By the time you're ready to take it public to a wide audience, you'll be fairly certain to have worked out all the kinks.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=yJXHUDSaJgsC\">Crossing the Chasm</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#do-less\">Do less</a></h3>\n<p>Do we really need that feature? Can we delete that code? Do we really need that command? Can we outsource to or partner with another company so that we don't have the build and maintain something?</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/4/7/ephemeralization/\">Ephemeralization</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#touch-own\">You touch it, you own it</a></h3>\n<p>Ownership can be a problem, especially if there's more than a few devs working on an app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding a new feature right next to some scary code? Improve the scary first. Maybe add a few tests.</li>\n<li>Adding a new instance variable to a 20 line controller method? Break it apart.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the hairiest of cases or the rushiest of rushes: make a mental note that it needs to be refactored. Bring it up with your boss. Explain that it would be irresponsible to build further there without some refactoring. If you lack a test harness to do this efficiently, fantastic! That is a clear step 1.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#question-everything\">Question everything</a></h3>\n<p>The status quo is never good enough.</p>\n<p>See:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=SIexi_qgq2gC\">The Innovator's Dilema</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=BmPPAjGaDuQC\">Blue Ocean Strategy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"#interfaces-matter\">Interfaces matter</a></h3>\n<p>Everything has an interface. A platform has an API. A computer has a keyboard, a mouse, and a GUI operating system.</p>\n<p>Teams have interfaces too. How do you file a bug or make a request? Where and when does the team collaborate with any other team?</p>\n<p>The two critical components of a good interface are that it be narrow and well-defined. A poor interface is one that is wide and poorly-defined.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/6/28/the_new_heroku_4_erosion_resistance_explicit_contracts/\">Explicit Contracts</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#names-matter\">Names matter</a></h3>\n<p>Think careful about how something is named. Pick exactly one name for each concept the user needs to track, and use it consistently. For example, Heroku add-on providers are always called providers, never &quot;vendor&quot; or &quot;partner&quot; or anything else. Writing <a href=\"https://addons.heroku.com/provider/resources/technical/reference/glossary\">a glossary</a> can be a good way to design the vocabulary around something.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#simplicity\">Maniacal focus on simplicity</a></h3>\n<p>There is no step 1.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#write-well\">Write well</a></h3>\n<p>Good writing is a powerful tool for communication.

Constructive criticism is the best kind. Avoid keeping quiet with your criticism about someone or something for the sake of politeness.

Candidates of this Master program achieve their education primarily through research activities, which lead to the development of a final thesis under the supervision of an active researcher within a research group of the Faculty.</p>\n<p>The emphasis on research distinguishes this program from those that are primarily based on courses and other educational activities. For these reasons, the link to one of the research groups operating in the Faculty is a key element for the completion of this master.</p>\n<p>This contact should be established right from the beginning. As one of our admission requirements, a researcher must accept to be the academic advisor of the prospective Master student (the admission of each student is also subject to acceptance by an admissions committee). The academic advisor will be responsible for mentoring the educational development of the candidate.</p>\n<p>Additionally, during the first year of studies the student will elaborate a draft of his thesis in which he chooses a topic and proposes a plan for the development of his project.</p>\n<p>This draft must be approved before the student begins work on the thesis itself, which will take place during the second year of studies. The elaboration of the draft, and of course, the thesis work itself, will take place within a research group of the Faculty.</p>\n<p>The research groups belong to the different branches of Engineering that operate in the Faculty: Electronics, Telecommunications or Systems.</p>\n<p>Our students will obtain a degree of Master in Engineering (by research), with specialization in the field covered by the final thesis and the major chosen by the student.</p>\n<p>In addition to his research activities, the student must take advanced subjects and take part in other similar activities in order to cover different areas of knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Graduate Profile</strong></p>\n<p>The graduate of this program will have achieved sufficient command of his area to perform a critical assessment of its state of the art, and to contribute at least with one opportunity or line of work for development or original application of ideas.</p>\n<p>This will be reflected in his final thesis, which is supposed to be a significant contribution to the literature of the area because of its approach and its creative use of knowledge, pointing out opportunities for innovation or strategies for an original solution of problems.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the graduates of this program will have developed learning skills that would allow them to continue their education at Doctoral level, which requires the ability to deal with original research work on an increased level of autonomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Accreditation</strong></p>\n<p>The Master in Engineering (by research) is a graduate program, which started the recognition process at the Ministry of Education and Culture in January 2, 2009.</p>\n<p><strong>Master thesis defense</strong></p>\n<p>I defended my thesis on April 5, 2013 at Seminary Room of the Universidad ORT Uruguay.</p>\n<p>The powerpoint presentation used in the defense can be downloaded from here.

It is organized each year by the EAFIT University, one of the most recognized universities and pioneer in the entrepreneurship topic.

People are great, the city is awesome and most important, you feel the innovation and the desire to improve the city in every person you came across.

This company would be formed if and only if the business plan by the group showed signs of feasibility to the Italian government. My activity during this period included the formation of this group (fourteen people) so they could function in the design, maintenance and management of a website whose main objective would be to promote tourism in Uruguay, without discarding other options.\nThe methodology of the courses was: the issues were downloaded from an institutional website to which each participant accessed through a username and password, then be studied.\nThis study was conducted during the class period (four hours daily) in subgroups according to the profile of each student.\nIn any event, within any topic that was being considered, if there were any doubts, my job was to clear them through examples and classes &quot;fast&quot;. They were quick due to limited time available for each module (as shown in detail below).\nRegarding the examination system, the same were made on-line within the same institutional site which had come down the material.\nNote that this project had a national scope, performing in six different locations throughout the country, which required a great job of coordination and communication among the various subsidiaries.

Over the years recommendations have changed, teams and tools have matured, but those changes rarely impact on historical archives.

It is clear the entrepreneur doesn't always have the tools to do this analysis; often neither the development provider has them or just his business is build software and nothing more. So this situation generates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Waste of money because the developed software doesn't meet the entrepreneur needs (or doesn't take into account some technological risks).</li>\n<li>Bad choice of the company that develops the software, maybe because of the ignorance about technical requirements that this provider should meet.</li>\n<li>Products that aren't validated against the market, which delays the success of them, loss of opportunity windows and above all, money.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In contrast, our workshop allows the entrepreneur to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define the list of functions they really need in their software and rank them.</li>\n<li>Discover the technical risks associated with the software they want to build.</li>\n<li>Generate list of skills that the software provider/developer must meet.</li>\n<li>Build a validation plan for their business in stages (proportionally with their investment possibilities) toward the final product.</li>\n<li>Get an initial idea of the required volume of work to develop the software (the estimation translates to possible cost ranges).</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 470px; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>The workshop is held with the team responsible for the entrepreneurship (1-6 people max.) and can be done remotely or in person. There are 3 sessions (at least) of 3 hours each, separated by at least 1 day. Each session has activities/games (specially chosen for each group) to generate the expected outputs of the workshop. These outputs will be write down in a collaborative way (between all the participants) in a document accessible from the first day.</p>\n<p>Out of the workshop hours, the participants may discuss the activities carried out, get additional information and maturate concepts which then can be added to the document. After the end of the workshop, participants will take a copy of the generated document so nothing ties them to us in any way. Obviously we will be very happy to continue working with them in the following stages if they want.</p>\n<p>I prepare the workshop using my experience in business/enterprises, many years of software development and my <a href=\"/software-engineering-professor\">university professor</a> knowledge for which I had developed a collection of games and activities. About the cost of the workshop, it has a base price and then it grows according to the mode (remotely/in person) and the number of sessions.</p>\n<p>This workshop was done several times during 2015, online and in presence to several <a href=\"http://www.vairix.com/\">VAIRIX Software Development</a> clients.</p>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/inception-workshop-service.png\" alt=\"Inception output example\" /></p>\n"},"meta":{"filePath":"./data/project/inception-workshop-for-entrepreneurs.dmd","slug":"inception-workshop-for-entrepreneurs","fdate":"July 18th 2017"}},

The physiological variable were taken to determine the movement restrictions. Then use graph theory to determine a single interpretation of the data.</p>\n<p>Robert Holt <strong>[3]</strong> adopted the technique of Divide &amp; Conquer to decompose each articulated object into primitive (rigid or articulated), estimating the motion of these simple parts. Decompositions and estimates then spread to the body recursively. This solution does not exploits the fact that parts belong to the same individual and are interrelated.</p>\n<p>Xiaoming Liu <strong>[4]</strong> used the correspondence between the 3D model and 2D image to calibrate the camera and to construct a sequence of movements in 3D perspective. The effectiveness of the model has yet to be tested in random positions of the body, especially those in which the triangle formed by the shoulders and chest are melted.</p>\n<p>Camillo J. Taylor <strong>[5]</strong> does not assume that the images are taken with a calibrated camera which means that the system can be used in photos obtained from the web or scanned. The method assumes that the relationship between points of the scene and its corresponding image can be modeled as a scale orthographic projection. Not suitable for use in situations where there are significant perspective effects. It also requires the user to specify which segment is the closest to the camera.</p>\n<p>The novelty of the approach proposed by Zhao and Li is based on a hierarchical model for the reconstruction of human body posture based on images captured using a single camera. Was decided to explore this last solution because of the various problems presented earlier. We also managed to contact the project leaders who provided additional information to that found on the web.</p>\n<p>This model uses a human skeleton with encoded biomechanical constraints on the various joints.</p>\n<p>The angular change of the joints in the same coordinate system is obtained between consecutive segments in a hierarchical manner through matrix transformations.</p>\n<p>The skeleton used contains 17 joints and 16 segments. It is assumed that we have geometric information of the individual (eg. length of each body segment).</p>\n<p>The body can be represented as a tree of rigid parts connected by specific joints. Each rigid part is allowed to move freely in their own domain on its immediate ancestor.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n  <tr>\n    <td><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-1.gif\"></td>\n    <td><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-2.gif\"></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<p>Each joint has three biomechanical constraints representing the angles of rotation about the axes X, Y, Z in its local coordinate system (a,b,g).</p>\n<p>Biomechanical constraints are important to construct the model since it decreases the solution space, but is not sufficient to determine the exact position of the body. For these reason we will user the concept of &quot;Criterion function&quot;.</p>\n<p>To define this concept will use the following notation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>segment_img<sub>i</sub> is the vector representing the body segment i in the 2D image.</li>\n<li>segment_proj<sub>i</sub> is the vector representing the projection of segment i in the 3D model.</li>\n<li>position_img<sub>i</sub> is joint position i in the 2D image.</li>\n<li>position_proj<sub>i</sub> is joint position i in the 3D model.</li>\n<li>Delta_scale is an array of weight parameters.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-3.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-3.gif\" /></li>\n<li><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-4.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-4.gif\" /></li>\n<li><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-5.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-5.gif\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This set of definitions lead to the &quot;Criterion function&quot;:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/SI_Annex-E-6.gif\" alt=\"SI_Annex-E-6.gif\" /></p>\n<p>where scale (n) are weight parameters that alter the result by segment and the joint on which you are working.

Encourage these humanoid pair simply necessary joints access and alter the angle between the two connecting segments.</p>\n<p>A humanoid is composed of the following objects:</p>\n<p>Humanoid is the root of the body and provides support to other body parts.\nJoint: is related to the root of the body and joints with other objects through objects Segments.\nSegment: Specifies the physical attributes of the connections between the joints.\nSite: Allows you represent items such as clothing, cameras and jewelry on the body.\nDispleasure: this object contains information about the range of motion allowed for the object within which it is located.</p>\n<p>Basically, the standard defines a tree of segments connected by joints that define the set of transformations which move from the root to each of the humanoid body appendages.</p>\n<p>There are different levels of articulation (LOA: Level of Articulation). For example we can define a humanoid with 14 joints (low joint) to a humanoid with 72 joints (high level of articulation).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Because the 3D modeling of the swing was established as an additional project scope, the result of research carried out allow to generate the knowledge needed to begin work on the 2D model.</p>\n<p>As a result of knowledge gained from the analysis of Criterion Function and the h-anim standard we have reached to the following conclusions.</p>\n<p>Generating the 2D model and the various metrics related to the golf swing will strengthen the concepts learned about the structure of the human body and the relationship between its parts. We will also generate a number of general classes and tools to facilitate the work of building the 3D model.</p>\n<p>The 3D model will be generated as an independent module that will communicate in the future with the 2D model via an interface. The idea is generate the 2D model so the resulting information from both, the model and the different metrics, will be stored before being consumed by the 3D model.</p>\n<p>We will try to stay within the standard h-anim as much as possible, especially in the representation of the various parts of the body and the relationship between these.</p>\n<p><strong>[1]</strong> Valentina Filova, France Solina, Jadran Lenarcic, Automatic reconstruction of 3D human arm motion from a monocular image sequence, Machine Vision and Applications (1998) 10, 1998, 223-231.</p>\n<p><strong>[2]</strong> Zen Chen and His-Jian Lee, Knowledge_Guided Visual Perception of 3-D Human Gait from a Single Image Sequence, Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions, Vol. 22, No. 2, March/April 1992, 336-342.</p>\n<p><strong>[3]</strong> Robert J.Holt, Arun N.Netravali, Thomas S.Huang, Richard J.Qian, Determining Articulated Motion from Perspective Views: A Decomposition Approach, IEEE Workshop on Motion of Non-Rigid and Articulated Objects, 1994, 126-137.</p>\n<p><strong>[4]</strong> Xiaoming Liu, Yueting Zhuang, and Yunhe Pan, Video Based Human Animation Technique, Proc. of the 7th ACM International Multimedia Conference, Orlando, Florida, USA, October 30-November 5, 1999.</p>\n<p><strong>[5]</strong> Camillo J.
