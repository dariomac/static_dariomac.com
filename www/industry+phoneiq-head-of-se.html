          <p>
                <p>My profile can be defined as an elastic one, mostly because of my adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>I can lead projects (as <strong>PM</strong> or <strong>Scrum Master</strong>) following agile methodologies (<strong>Scrum</strong>, <strong>XP</strong>) or more traditional ones, taking care of the complete <strong>SDLC</strong> (mainly requirement elicitation/specification and <strong>quality assurance</strong>). In my role as a final-year project tutor at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I constantly face new challenges, but more than anything, new teams of people. I believe in self-managed teams and feel satisfied knowing that during our time working together, we grew individually and as a team.</p>
<p>Also, I love coding. My management skills are complemented by in-depth technical knowledge, ranging from defining high-performance architectures (<strong>NGINX</strong>, <strong>PM2</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, in-memory or database caches) to the use of backend technologies (<strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, .<strong>Net</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>), databases (<strong>MySql</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>Oracle</strong>, <strong>SQL Server</strong>), web frameworks (<strong>ASP.NET</strong> <strong>MVC</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>) and frontend ones (<strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Handlebars</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Highcharts JS</strong>, <strong>SVG</strong>).</p>
<p>Besides this, and perhaps because I am a <strong>Software Engineering professor</strong> at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I feel very comfortable speaking in public. For this reason, I usually contribute to improving the visibility of the companies where I work by participating in conferences as a speaker, writing articles in blogs and even adding content to Twitter (and other <strong>social networks</strong>).</p>
<p>Finally, I am interested in conducting <strong>scientific research</strong> in the field of Software Engineering to add value to its body of knowledge. At the same time, I want to satisfy some practical needs of the industry, especially those related to <strong>quality assurance</strong> and <strong>decision making</strong>. I think it may be helpful to bring tools from the scientific environment closer to the daily activities of software development. In order to achieve this objective and to make a first approximation to the scientific field, I did a <strong>Master in Engineering</strong> at Universidad ORT Uruguay.</p>

              <p>This time at VAIRIX I have a more technical role. In some projects, I'm working as a developer on the full <strong>javascript</strong> stack (<strong>Node.js</strong> + <strong>React</strong>). In other projects, I'm right behind the team, serving them in a <strong>Scrum Master</strong> way, but not visible to the client. The idea of this function is to monitor <strong>quality</strong>, management and social skills and then support the team to solve problems related to these issues.</p>

              <p>The end-of-degree-project is a complex task where the undergraduate student has to integrate the concepts, contents, knowledge, procedures, and skills that were developed throughout their studies.
I think my job as tutor's is to help students to sort things out. As they never faced real situations/problems, I feel that my responsibility is to guide them with advises from my own experience. Also, is always good to keep an eye on the written and oral presentation preparation.</p>

              <h2>Content Distribution System (aka &#x27;H&#x27;)</h2>
              <p>‘H’ is a collection of <strong>Node.js</strong> microservices oriented to the distribution of content using different channels. The content was stored in a <strong>MySQL</strong> database using a proprietary <strong>CMS</strong> format. Then one of those microservices retrieve each piece of content and normalize it to a well-structured & easy to use <strong>JSON</strong> abstraction. Finally, each service renders that abstraction to specific channel’s format, adapting the content to follow each distribution channel policies & restrictions (i.e. <strong>Google AMP</strong>, <strong>Facebook Instant Articles</strong>, <strong>MSN</strong>, <strong>Google News</strong>). This microservices <strong>net</strong> support ~25 requests/sec using only one service with 5 instances of them running, coordinated by <strong>PM2</strong> process manager with an <strong>NGINX</strong> as reverse proxy supporting ~1000 req/sec.</p>
